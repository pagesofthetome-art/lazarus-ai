# ci-tauri-build.sh — the check that asks "is this product still buildable?"
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# On 2026-09-01 `npm run tauri build` was measured on Windows and reproduced on
# macOS: it wrote the installers to disk and then exited 1.
#
#     Finished 2 bundles at: … .app … .dmg … .app.tar.gz (updater)
#     Error A public key has been found, but no private key.
#           Make sure to set `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable.
#     TAURI_BUILD_EXIT=1
#
# That defect was already present at 10bfa0d7 (v2.6.7), i.e. in the shipped
# product: `bundle.createUpdaterArtifacts` asked the bundler for signed updater
# artifacts while `plugins.updater.pubkey` sat next to it, so the bundler
# demanded a private key nobody outside the release runner has. Anybody who
# cloned the repo and built it got exit 1 — a fork, a contributor, an AGPL-3.0
# recipient exercising §6.
#
# Nobody noticed for one structural reason: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` never ran
# `tauri build`. It ran `npm run build` (vite), `cargo check`, `cargo test` —
# every one of which passes on a config that cannot be bundled. The only place
# `tauri build` ever ran was release.yml, and there
# `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` comes out of GitHub secrets, so the one lane that
# could have seen the failure was the one lane configured not to hit it.
#
# THE KEY, AND WHY THIS SCRIPT REFUSES TO HAVE ONE
# ------------------------------------------------
# This script deliberately builds with NO signing key, and it unsets the two
# signing variables itself rather than merely not setting them:
#
#   * A gate that reads a secret is a gate that can go quietly green in a fork,
#     where the secret does not exist. The usual shapes of that — `if:
#     ${{ secrets.X != '' }}`, `continue-on-error: true`, `|| true` — all end in
#     a check that reports success while having verified nothing. None of them
#     appear here, and none can: there is no secret to be missing.
#   * Keyless is also the configuration the defect lives in. Handing the build a
#     key would have made the broken 10bfa0d7 config build cleanly and the gate
#     would have been green on the exact commit it exists to fail.
#   * A fork is therefore held to precisely the check upstream is held to, with
#     no repository settings and no secrets to configure.
#
# The trade this makes, stated plainly: if `createUpdaterArtifacts` is ever
# switched back on in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` (it is legitimately on in the
# real release branch, where the key exists), this gate goes red and says why.
# That is the intended reading — "this tree cannot be built by anyone who is not
# the release runner" is a finding, not a false alarm — but it does mean the
# release branch has to pass the updater-artifact request to the release build
# instead of baking it into the checked-in config. That is what release.yml
# does: `--config src-tauri/tauri.release.conf.json` on its tauri-action step,
# a one-field overlay this script never reads (release-build-gate.test.ts
# holds both halves of that arrangement).
#
# WHAT "PASSED" MEANS HERE
# ------------------------
# Three conditions, all required, in this order:
#   1. `tauri build` exited 0. Taken from PIPESTATUS[0], not from `tee`.
#   2. The build left installers behind. An exit 0 that bundles nothing is not
#      a build.
#   3. The log carries no signing complaint. This is the belt to (1)'s braces:
#      the original defect printed its error AFTER "Finished 2 bundles at", so
#      artifact existence proves nothing, and if a future tauri demotes that
#      error to a warning the exit code would stop reporting it.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/ci-tauri-build.sh                # build the checked-in config
#   scripts/ci-tauri-build.sh -c '<json>'    # extra args go to `tauri build`
#
# Sourceable: `main` only runs when the file is executed, so tests can source it
# and call `build_verdict` directly (see the sibling of this file in
# src/lib/__tests__/).
