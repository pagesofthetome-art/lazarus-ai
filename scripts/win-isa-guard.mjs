// win-isa-guard.mjs: the Windows-only half of the K1 (3.0.1) ISA guard.
//
// review-k1-avx.md (Opus, final review) found that verify-sidecar-isa.sh's
// old rule ("no mnemonic starting with 'v' in the baseline") is not
// holdable under MSVC: the MSVC-STL and CRT ship their own AVX2 fast paths
// (vector_algorithms.obj, wmemcmp) inside every module they are linked
// into, switched at runtime through __isa_available/__isa_enabled, and a
// naive mnemonic grep cannot tell "linked in but runtime-guarded" apart
// from "compiled in and unconditional" (the actual K1 bug). It also
// produced flat false positives (verr/verw read out of data bytes
// dumpbin/objdump happens to disassemble).
//
// This module implements Opus's replacement rule (R1-R3, R6):
//
//   1. Detect VEX/EVEX instructions by their OPCODE BYTE (0xC4, 0xC5, 0x62),
//      not by mnemonic spelling. In 64-bit code these three bytes are
//      unambiguous (the 32-bit-only meanings LDS/LES/BOUND do not exist in
//      long mode), so this is exact, not heuristic, and it makes verr/verw/
//      vmread false positives structurally impossible: their real opcode is
//      0F 00 /4 and 0F 00 /5, first byte 0x0F, never 0xC4/0xC5/0x62.
//   2. Resolve every hit's owning function from the linker .map file
//      (Publics by Value + Static symbols, both sections use the same row
//      shape: "<seg:off> <name> <VA> [f] [i] <Lib:Object>", and Lib:Object
//      is always the last whitespace token because no object/library name
//      in a .map file contains a space).
//   3. Decide per hit:
//      - Lib:Object is msvcprt:vector_algorithms.obj, or starts with
//        "MSVCRT:", or the owning symbol is EXACTLY wmemcmp/memcmp AND the
//        owning object is one of the specific objects that match was hand
//        verified against (WMEMCMP_MEMCMP_HOST_OBJECTS, see isAllowlisted
//        below): ALLOWED (CRT/STL allowlist, R3.1). These carry their own
//        runtime dispatch, verified by hand in review-k1-avx.md; a naive
//        "well it also needs a guard in this function" rule would wrongly
//        flag __std_find_trivial_impl (checked in its OWN body) as fine but
//        flag _Dispatch_pos / _Make_bitmap (checked in their CALLER) as
//        unprotected, which they are not. (review-waechter-windows.md BL3:
//        a bare substring/regex match on the symbol name alone, without the
//        object condition, let an unrelated own-code symbol that merely
//        contains "memcmp" in a mangled name through as ALLOWED_CRT; fixed
//        by requiring both conditions together.)
//      - The decoded operands name an Intel APX extended general purpose
//        register (r16-r31, as base, index or plain operand):
//        DECODE_ARTIFACT_APX, i.e. these bytes are data the disassembler
//        swept over as if they were code, not an instruction the compiler
//        emitted (R7, see hasApxRegisterOperand below). Printed per hit and
//        counted in its own summary line, never silently dropped, and it
//        does NOT count as unprotected.
//      - Anything else ("own code": ggml-*.obj, llama-*.obj, common.obj,
//        server-*.obj, ggml-vulkan.obj) is ALLOWED only if, within the
//        owning function's address range, there is a read of
//        __isa_available / __isa_enabled / _Avx2WmemEnabled at an address
//        BEFORE the hit, and a conditional jump (any j-mnemonic except jmp)
//        sitting IMMEDIATELY after a cmp/test instruction that is itself
//        bound to that same read (same memory location, or the register the
//        read just loaded), whose target lands AFTER the hit and still
//        inside the function (the block-skip shape the MSVC auto-vectorizer
//        and the STL dispatcher both emit; see checkDominance below).
//        Anything else is UNPROTECTED, RED. (review-waechter-windows.md N1:
//        an earlier version only asked for "some isa-flag read before the
//        hit" and "some conditional jump landing past it", with no
//        requirement that the jump actually evaluate that read; that let an
//        unrelated read plus an unrelated jump wave a real unconditional AVX
//        block through. Closed by binding the jump to the read via an
//        immediately-adjacent cmp/test, at the cost of also rejecting some
//        real, correctly-guarded MSVC code whose scheduler put other
//        instructions between the cmp and the jump; see checkDominance's own
//        comment and its UNPROTECTED message for the known false-red forms
//        A-D this costs.)
//
// This is an approximation of a real control-flow graph, not one (R3,
// "Bewertung der Regel, ehrlich"): it cannot see a function that reads the
// ISA flag for an unrelated reason and then falls into unconditional AVX
// anyway. The three controls in verify-sidecar-isa.sh's Windows branch
// (positive: haswell has ANY hit at all; negative: haswell's OWN-CODE
// kernels come out UNPROTECTED under this same decision logic, so the rule
// has not been loosened into "allow everything"; red-probe: the fixtures in
// scripts/__fixtures__/win-isa/ prove the decision function itself, not
// just real files) exist to bound that risk, not to remove it.
//
// Deliberately dependency-free (no npm install step for a build guard) and
// works on both dumpbin's Intel-syntax output (the box, and Windows CI once
// a Developer Command Prompt is on PATH); see readTextFileAuto for the
// encoding note.
//
// SCOPE, STATED HONESTLY (review-waechter-windows.md N6): this guard proves
// "no unprotected VEX/EVEX instruction", i.e. AVX-and-above. It does NOT
// prove "runs on every x86-64 CPU". A legacy-encoded instruction above the
// x86-64 baseline (POPCNT, LZCNT, TZCNT, the SSE4.2 string/CRC32 ops) is not
// VEX/EVEX-coded and would pass through unnoticed even if compiled in
// unconditionally, and would fault with the identical 0xC000001D on the same
// customer machine. For K1 as reported this residual gap is accepted, not
// closed:
//   - BMI1/BMI2 (ANDN, BEXTR, BZHI, PDEP, PEXT, ...) do NOT need separate
//     handling: they are VEX-encoded instructions (VEX.LZ.0F38, per the
//     Intel SDM), so the existing 0xC4/0xC5/0x62 first-byte check already
//     covers them.
//   - POPCNT/LZCNT/TZCNT were checked for cheap opcode-byte coverage and
//     rejected: their real encoding is a mandatory 0xF3 prefix followed by a
//     0F-map opcode (F3 0F B8 for POPCNT, F3 0F BD for LZCNT, F3 0F BC for
//     TZCNT). Unlike 0xC4/0xC5/0x62, a leading 0xF3 byte is NOT unambiguous
//     in 64-bit code: it is the ordinary REP/REPE prefix and the mandatory
//     prefix for a large family of unrelated scalar SSE instructions
//     (MOVSS, CVTSI2SS, ADDSS, ...), so a first-byte-only rule would flag
//     huge numbers of ordinary SSE instructions as false positives, and a
//     rule that also inspects the trailing 0F B8/BD/BC bytes stops being a
//     one-byte structural check and starts being exactly the kind of
//     multi-byte, easy-to-get-subtly-wrong decoder this rewrite was meant to
//     avoid. Not implemented; flagged here rather than silently dropped.

// R7 (lu-301/bau/isa-guard-apx.md): an Intel APX register in the decoded
// operands means the disassembler decoded DATA, not code.
//
// R1's opcode-byte rule is exact about what 0xC4/0xC5/0x62 mean IF the byte
// really starts an instruction. dumpbin and objdump cannot know that: both
// sweep .text linearly, so a jump table, a switch table or a constant pool
// that MSVC placed in .text is decoded as if it were code, and any data byte
// that happens to be 0x62 opens an EVEX decode which then eats whatever
// follows it. That residual data-misdecode class is what the opcode-byte
// rule shrank (verr/verw/vmread became structurally impossible) but could
// not remove.
//
// The cheap, structural way to tell such a misdecode apart from real code
// here is the register file. r16-r31 exist only with Intel APX. MSVC for x64
// does not emit APX: no /arch switch selects it, and neither toolset this
// guard has met does so (14.44 on the box, 14.51 on the CI runner). On top
// of that, this project's own objects are compiled at the x64 baseline, with
// the AVX kernels confined to the ggml-cpu-* tier DLLs, so an own-code
// instruction addressing memory through r25 is not something the compiler
// could have produced at all. It comes out of a disassembler walking bytes
// that were never instructions.
//
// What triggered this rule (sidecar-windows.yml run 35640770023, job
// 106469248703, release/3.0.1-prep, log excerpt in
// lu-301/bau/isa-guard-ci-auszug.txt), two hits with the same signature:
//
//   0000000180097301: vorps   zmm25{k4}{z},zmm15,zmmword ptr [r25]
//                     fn=$LN4275  obj=clip.obj                 (mtmd.dll)
//   00000001800dcadc: vpshufb xmm16,xmm30,xmmword ptr [r25]
//                     fn=$LN191   obj=server-context:server-tools.obj
//                                                  (llama-server-impl.dll)
//
// Three signals converge on both: the owner is a $LN local label, which is
// what MSVC attaches to jump tables and data blocks inside .text and never
// to a function; the operands are AVX-512 (zmm, a k-mask, {z}) in modules
// built without /arch:AVX512; and the base register is an APX EGPR. The same
// two modules on the box, built with linker 14.44, showed 24 and 72 hits and
// zero unprotected (review-k1-avx.md, "Zusatzbefund"). The runner's newer
// toolset ships a dumpbin that knows APX and therefore spells those same
// data bytes as an APX instruction where the older one did not.
//
// THE COST, NAMED, not hidden: if a future MSVC does start emitting APX code
// for x64, a genuinely unguarded APX instruction would be classified as an
// artifact here instead of going RED. That is bounded, not open ended: a new
// linker Major.Minor already fails the build through the toolset pin in
// verify-sidecar-isa.sh (WINDOWS_REVIEWED_LINKER_VERSIONS) until it has been
// reviewed by hand, and this rule is one of the things such a review has to
// re-check.
//
// The rule is kept as narrow as the evidence: ONLY the extended general
// purpose registers count. zmm16-zmm31, the k-mask registers, the {z}
// zeroing suffix and every other AVX-512 spelling are NOT evidence of a
// misdecode, because MSVC does emit those under /arch:AVX512, so a real
// unguarded AVX-512 instruction addressed through the ordinary rax-r15
// registers still comes out UNPROTECTED (second hit in the fixture
// scripts/__fixtures__/win-isa/apx-decode-artifact.*). There is deliberately
// no allowlist by file name either: the decision reads the decoded operands
// only, so clip.obj and mtmd.dll get no special treatment whatsoever.
//
// Word boundaries on both sides keep this off unrelated spellings: "cr16"
// and "dr16" do not match (the boundary fails before the r), and the
// optional d/w/b suffix covers r16d/r16w/r16b as well as AT&T's %r25.

// review-waechter-windows.md Final Review Runde 2, section 3 (Auflage A2):
// this closes real holes, but it is stricter than some genuinely protected
// MSVC code, and rot is the direction that costs a human an hour, not the
// direction that costs a customer a crash, so that trade was made
// deliberately. Four forms were KNOWN to come out UNPROTECTED (false red)
// even though they are correctly guarded; if the address flagged UNPROTECTED
// matches one of these when disassembled by hand, it is a known codegen
// pattern, not a K1 regression:
//   (i)   FIXED, no longer false red, see FLAG_PRESERVING_MNEMONICS and
//         findBoundConditionalJump above and the fixture
//         scheduled-jump-own-code.*: the shape shipped in wmemcmp (ggml.dll),
//         "cmp [isa],eax / mov rbx,rcx / mov r9,rcx / mov r10,rdx /
//         je <past-the-hit>", and the same shape with one intervening mov
//         found in llama.dll on MSVC 14.51 (llama-kv-cache.obj, the two
//         vpmullq at 18007AA0D/18007AA28, lu-301/bau/isa-review-1451.md
//         section 2). The MSVC scheduler put unrelated movs between the cmp
//         and the jump instead of emitting them back to back. Those movs
//         cannot write EFLAGS, so the jump still evaluates that same cmp and
//         the guard now follows it across them;
//   (ii)  a cached comparison register: "mov eax,[isa] / mov ecx,eax /
//         cmp ecx,6 / jl <past-the-hit>" - the load and the compare use
//         different registers, linked through a copy checkDominance does
//         not trace;
//   (iii) a partial-register test: "movzx eax,byte ptr [isa] / test al,al /
//         je <past-the-hit>" - the compare's first operand is a sub-register
//         (al) of the register the load wrote (eax), which the current
//         word-bounded register match treats as a different register;
//   (iv)  a bit-test form: "bt dword ptr [isa],5 / jae <past-the-hit>" - the
//         STL's "__isa_enabled & (1 << N)" expressed as bt/jae instead of a
//         masked cmp/test, which is not a cmp/test mnemonic at all.
// None of these are exploitable the way the two fake-green shapes above
// were (they can only make real, guarded code fail RED, never let
// unguarded code through GREEN), so they are named here as an accepted,
// documented gap rather than fixed. If checkDominance is ever loosened to
// cover one of these, it needs its own checked-in fixture the way the two
