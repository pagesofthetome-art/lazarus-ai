/**
 * Put the release this build belongs to back into prerelease, unless it is the
 * one someone has already flipped to Latest.
 *
 * release.yml asks tauri-action for `prerelease: true`, and on the workflow's
 * own primary trigger that input is ignored: tauri-action only passes the flag
 * to createRelease, and on `on: release: [published]` the release already
 * exists, so the action reuses it untouched. A release published as a full
 * release therefore became GitHub's `latest` the moment CI attached the
 * binaries, with the download routes and every installed updater following
 * within minutes. That is exactly the 2026-08-10 incident the comment in
 * release.yml describes as fixed.
 *
 * Idempotent, and it can never undo a deliberate flip. Note that "deliberate"
 * cannot be read off the Latest flag alone: GitHub points Latest at any full
 * release the moment it is published, so inside the run that published it, the
 * flag means nothing. PUBLISHED_TAG carries the tag from this run's
 * `release: published` event; when it names the release we are looking at, the
 * release was published seconds ago and cannot have been verified, so it goes
 * back to prerelease. Outside that case the Latest flag is a human's verdict
 * and is left alone.
 *
 * Usage: TAG=v2.6.5 [PUBLISHED_TAG=v2.6.5] node scripts/enforce-prerelease.mjs
