/**
 * Put an "old release" banner on every release except the current one.
 *
 * Why: GitHub keeps every release page public and Google ranks them. In the two
 * weeks to 2026-08-05 the release pages for v2.5.8 and v2.5.10 drew more unique
 * visitors than v2.6.2 did, and the in-app waitlist was still logging sign-ups
 * from 2.5.5 and 2.5.6 builds. Someone arriving from a search result had nothing
 * on the page telling them they were looking at an old version.
 *
 * Doing this by hand ages badly, which is the same failure the pinned download
 * route had. So it runs on every release: the new one gets its banner stripped
 * (in case it carried one), everything else gets one added. Idempotent, so a
 * re-run or a manual dispatch is free.
