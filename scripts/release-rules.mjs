/**
 * True when this release must be forced back to prerelease.
 *
 * release.yml passes `prerelease: true` to tauri-action, and on the workflow's
 * OWN primary trigger that input does nothing. tauri-action only passes
 * draft/prerelease to createRelease (src/create-release.ts): when the release
 * already exists, which it always does on `on: release: [published]`, the
 * action reuses it and never patches the flag. So the guarantee written into
 * that comment ("a build is not a decision") held for workflow_dispatch and
 * for nothing else, and a release published as a full release went straight to
 * Latest with the download routes and every updater following within minutes.
 * That is the 2026-08-10 incident the comment says was fixed.
 *
 * The question this answers is "has a human verified this release?", NOT "is it
 * already Latest". Those look the same and are not: GitHub moves the Latest
 * pointer to any published full release BY ITSELF, immediately, with nobody
 * deciding anything. So the first version of this rule — `rel.id === latest.id
 * -> leave it alone` — was a guaranteed no-op in exactly the case it was
 * written for: a release published as a full release IS already Latest by the
 * time this job runs, the guard fired, and the release nobody had opened kept
 * the Latest flag and the updater traffic that comes with it.
 *
 * Verification happens on a real machine AFTER this build produced installers,
 * so nothing this run publishes can be verified yet: `publishedByThisRun` (the
 * `release: published` event that started this run names this same release)
 * means force it back, whatever the Latest pointer says.
 *
 * The deliberate flip stays safe: on a manual re-run over some older tag no
 * release event named it, `publishedByThisRun` is false, and a release that is
 * the flagged Latest is left alone — that flag is then a human's verdict.
 *
 * @param {object|null|undefined} rel    the release this build belongs to
 * @param {object|null|undefined} latest `/releases/latest`, or null if none
 * @param {{publishedByThisRun?: boolean}} [ctx] run context, see above
