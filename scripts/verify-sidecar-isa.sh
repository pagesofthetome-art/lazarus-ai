# verify-sidecar-isa.sh: the guard for K1 (3.0.1). Fails the build RED when
# the dynamic-ISA sidecar (scripts/build-llama.sh, Windows/Linux) is not what
# it claims to be.
#
# Two things this checks, both measured on the actual built files, not on the
# cmake command line that produced them (a wrong flag upstream, a stale
# build cache, or a future llama.cpp release changing its own defaults could
# all make the command line lie):
#
#   1. The BASELINE modules (the "x64" and "sse42" CPU variants, every named
#      base module -- ggml, ggml-base, ggml-vulkan, llama, llama-common,
#      llama-server-impl, mtmd -- and the llama-server exe itself) must
#      contain NO AVX-or-above instruction. These are the files every CPU
#      loads no matter how old, so an AVX instruction inside one of them is
#      exactly the K1 bug: a "dynamic" build that is secretly still a fixed
#      x86-64-v3 (or higher) binary. Checked by disassembling and searching
#      for ymm/zmm registers and VEX/EVEX-coded mnemonics (they are the ones
#      objdump prints with a leading "v", e.g. vmovaps, vzeroupper,
#      vfmadd231ps; no plain SSE mnemonic is spelled that way).
#   2. Every CPU-tier VARIANT module must stay at or below the ISA ceiling
#      its own tier is supposed to have (sandybridge/ivybridge/piledriver:
#      AVX at most, no AVX2, no AVX-512; haswell/alderlake: AVX2 at most, no
#      AVX-512; skylakex and above: AVX-512 is the top tier, nothing to
#      cap). The rules and the tier table live in
#      scripts/lib/isa-guard-linux-rules.sh (shared with
#      scripts/verify-sidecar-isa.selftest.sh, which proves this logic
#      against checked-in fixtures with no ELF file or objdump needed,
#      runnable on any platform). SKEPTIKER-LINUX-WEB-K1.md found the
#      earlier version of this script checked 4 of the staged modules
#      (x64, sse42, ggml-base, exe) and skipped every other base module and
#      every variant's own ceiling outright.
#   3. Every file actually staged in the companions directory must be a
#      recognised module (a known base module, a known CPU-tier variant, or
#      a SONAME-versioned sibling of one of those) -- an unrecognised module
#      turns this guard RED rather than being silently skipped (fail
#      closed).
#   4. The HASWELL variant (the first AVX2 tier) MUST contain at least one
#      AVX-or-above instruction. Without this positive control, a
#      disassembler that silently failed, or a grep pattern that never
#      matches anything, would make check 1 pass on every input, including
#      a build that produced no real code at all.
#
# Also fails RED when an expected CPU variant is simply missing from the
# companions directory (a partial build, or a future cmake refactor that
# drops a name this project still assumes).
#
# TOOLSET PIN (review-waechter-windows.md N7): the Windows branch below
# trusts a specific, hand-disassembled CRT/STL allowlist
# (msvcprt:vector_algorithms.obj and the wmemcmp/memcmp fast path, see
# win-isa-guard.mjs isAllowlisted) rather than re-deriving it from source on
# every run. That trust is pinned to a Major.Minor MSVC LINKER version
# (WINDOWS_REVIEWED_LINKER_VERSIONS below, currently "14.44 14.51":
# 14.44 is MSVC 19.44.35222.0 / VS 2022 17.14, lu-301/bau/review-k1-avx.md
# section 3; 14.51 is MSVC 19.51.36256 / VS 2026, reviewed 21.09.2026 on the
# GitHub-runner dumps in lu-301/bau/isa-review-14.51/, written up in
# lu-301/bau/isa-review-1451.md) and
# check_toolset_version turns the guard red the moment a build used a
# different one, rather than silently keep trusting an allowlist nobody
# re-checked. To clear a red toolset-pin failure: re-run the Opus-style
# manual disassembly review (dumpbin /disasm against the new toolset's
# msvcprt:vector_algorithms.obj and wmemcmp/common.obj, unicode.obj,
# ggml-backend-reg.obj, server-context.obj, the exact objects
# win-isa-guard.mjs's isAllowlisted trusts, see WMEMCMP_MEMCMP_HOST_OBJECTS
# there) to confirm the new toolset's CRT/STL fast paths are still
# self-guarded by __isa_enabled/_Avx2WmemEnabled the same way, then add the
# new linker Major.Minor to WINDOWS_REVIEWED_LINKER_VERSIONS. Realistically
# this is not a rare event: windows-latest pulls a new MSVC patch release on
# roughly a one-to-two-month cadence, so expect this pin to need bumping on
# that cadence, most visibly in a release run; it is a planned, periodic
# cost of trusting a hand-reviewed allowlist rather than a rare emergency,
# and the sidecar build cache (keyed on hashFiles('scripts/build-llama.sh'))
# only defers it, it does not remove it.
#
# DURCHSICHTSSTAND 14.51 (21.09.2026, lu-301/bau/isa-review-1451.md, dumps in
# lu-301/bau/isa-review-14.51/): the CRT/STL allowlist holds on MSVC
# 19.51.36256 / VS 2026. All 924 allowlisted VEX/EVEX hits across the nine
# base modules sit in msvcprt:vector_algorithms.obj, in 18 functions, and
# every one of them reaches its first AVX instruction only through a read of
# __isa_enabled plus a conditional jump over the block, either in its own
# body or, for the four helper families _Find_end_cmpeq, _Search_cmpeq,
# _Impl_first_avx and _Impl_last_avx, in the dispatching caller. This
# toolset produced no wmemcmp/memcmp hit at all, so the
# WMEMCMP_MEMCMP_HOST_OBJECTS half of the allowlist was not exercised by
# 14.51 and stays trusted on the 14.44 review alone. The one new finding,
# two vpmullq in llama.dll's llama-kv-cache.obj, was a false red of known
# form (i) and was closed in win-isa-guard.mjs's checkDominance, not
# allowlisted away.

# filename ggml itself opens, not merely a file that contains the right
# substring. Read at the pin (ggml-backend-reg.cpp:472-520,
# ggml_backend_load_best):
#   - CPU variants are found by a SCAN: every regular file in the search
#     directory is a candidate if `filename.find(file_prefix) == 0` (the
#     name starts with "[lib]ggml-cpu-") AND `entry.path().extension() ==
#     file_extension` (the extension is EXACTLY ".so"/".dll", not ".so.0").
#     A versioned SONAME copy like "libggml-cpu-x64.so.0" has extension
#     ".0", so ggml never even considers it: the loader would see NO CPU
#     backend at all and the app would die on the first model load, while a
#     guard that matches "*ggml-cpu-x64.so*" (Runde 2's version) stays
#     green.
#   - "vulkan" (and any other backend without per-CPU variants) is NOT
#     found by that scan at all: "libggml-vulkan.so" does not start with
#     "libggml-vulkan-" (the scan prefix always has a trailing hyphen
#     because it is built for "<name>-<variant>" files). It is only found
#     through the FALLBACK branch a few lines down, which requires the
#     single EXACT filename "[lib]ggml-vulkan.<ext>" to exist verbatim in
#     one of the two search paths.
# So the guard's own filename check must be exact-match, not substring: the
# only wildcard-worthy part is the "lib" prefix, and that is not even a
# wildcard, it is a fixed, platform-determined string
# (ggml/CMakeLists.txt:79-83 strips it only "if (WIN32)", so it is "lib" on

# very often an ABSOLUTE path into the CI runner's own build directory, a

# source for the literal word "RPATH" (what Runde 1 did) cannot see this:
# it is CMake's own default, not a line anyone wrote. The only way to know

# BLOCKER B4 (review-sidecar.md, Runde 2): Runde 2 only ran this check on

# --- The disassembler (Linux only from here on) -----------------------------

# AUFLAGE e (review-isalinux.md Runde 2): objdump's `-D` disassembles EVERY
# section, including .rodata/.data, and will happily print an instruction
# mnemonic for whatever data bytes happen to live there -- a false alarm
# that has nothing to do with the code this guard actually cares about.
# `-d` (used below, both for objdump and llvm-objdump) is the deliberate
# choice against that: it only disassembles sections objdump's own ELF
# section-flag reading considers executable (SHF_EXECINSTR: .text, .plt,
# .init, .fini, ...), so a constant table or string literal placed in
# .rodata is never fed to the classifier at all. That is a real, structural
# narrowing, not a guess.
#
# It does not fully retire the risk, and this guard does not pretend it
# does: a linear disassembler walking an EXECUTABLE section can still
# print a "false" instruction out of padding bytes, alignment NOPs, or an
# inlined jump/lookup table placed inside .text next to real code -- the
# exact class of finding review-k1-avx.md's "Zusatzbefund" hit on the
# Windows side (dumpbin decoded verr/verw/vmread/vmwrite/vmcall/vmfunc out
# of data bytes; win-isa-guard.mjs's fix was ownership resolution via the
# linker .map, ordinary Linux objdump output has no equivalent). This
# script's own header already explains why Linux does not need that
# specific allowlist machinery (no statically-linked, runtime-dispatched
# CRT/STL the way MSVC ships): the modules this guard checks are gcc-built
# ggml/llama.cpp code with no comparable runtime-dispatch fast path, so an
# UNCONDITIONAL AVX mnemonic anywhere in a baseline/sub-ceiling module's
# executable section is already the K1 shape, not a legitimate self-guarded
# fast path that needs dominance-checking to clear.
#
# How to tell a genuine hit from a data-byte misread if this guard ever
# does go red on a real Linux build: the FAIL diagnostic below prints the
# first 5 matching lines with their addresses. For each address, run
# `objdump -d --no-show-raw-insn "$file" | grep -B5 -A2 '^  <addr>:'` (or
# `nm -D "$file"` / `objdump -t "$file"` to find which symbol's range that
# address falls in) and read the surrounding lines: real code disassembles
# into a coherent instruction stream (a function prologue nearby, sane
# operands, a `ret`/jump that makes sense as control flow); a data-byte
# misread typically appears right after a function's actual `ret` -- inside
# padding, an alignment NOP run, or a jump table -- and the "instructions"
# immediately before/after it will themselves look like nonsense (odd
# byte-length encodings, operands that reference nothing). If in doubt,
# cross-check against the same file's .rodata contents (`objdump -s -j
# .rodata "$file"`) for the same byte pattern -- data that legitimately
# belongs in .rodata occasionally gets placed in a read-only .text-adjacent
# section by the linker, and finding the exact bytes there settles it.
#
# Every call site captures this function's stdout via `$(disassemble ...)`
# to get the disassembly text, so a diagnostic printed with plain vlog (which
# writes to stdout) would be silently swallowed INTO that captured text
# instead of ever reaching the terminal, defeating the point of logging it
# at all (found the hard way: the tool-name line never appeared, even though
# the code "ran"). log_disassembler_choice writes to stderr (>&2)
# specifically so it survives being called from inside a command
# substitution.

# nonzero exit is captured explicitly (never left to `set -e` abort the
# whole script silently mid-command-substitution, the same
