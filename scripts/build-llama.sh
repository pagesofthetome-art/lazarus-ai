# build-llama.sh — build the bundled llama.cpp `llama-server` sidecar for
# Lazarus's built-in inference engine (P0 of the built-in-engine plan).
#
# mac: the produced binary is statically linked with Metal embedded, so a
# single self-contained file drops into `src-tauri/bin/llama-server-<triple>`
# and Tauri picks it up as an `externalBin` sidecar (target triple appended,
# code-signed with the app on macOS).
#
# Windows and Linux (K1, 3.0.1): the binary is dynamic and loads its CPU
# kernels and the Vulkan backend at runtime (GGML_BACKEND_DL +
# GGML_CPU_ALL_VARIANTS, see cmake_flags_for below): a fixed x86-64-v3
# binary made every pre-Haswell/pre-Excavator CPU crash with 0xC000001D
# (Windows) or SIGILL (Linux) before llama-server could log anything. The
# companion ggml-cpu-*/ggml-vulkan libraries this produces land in
# `src-tauri/resources/llama/<triple>/`, bundled as Tauri `resources`
# (tauri.windows.conf.json / tauri.linux.conf.json) alongside the exe
# sidecar, not as more externalBin entries.
#
# Idempotent: clones/pins llama.cpp once into a build cache, reuses it on reruns.
# Binaries and companion libraries are NOT committed, see
# src-tauri/bin/.gitignore and src-tauri/resources/llama/.gitignore.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/build-llama.sh                 # build for the host target triple
#   scripts/build-llama.sh <triple> ...    # build for one or more explicit triples
#   scripts/build-llama.sh --check         # verify already-built host binary boots
#
# Supported triples:
#   aarch64-apple-darwin      (Metal, embedded shaders)   — mac-first
#   x86_64-apple-darwin       (Metal, embedded shaders)   — mac-first
#   x86_64-pc-windows-msvc    (Vulkan)                    — P6, after launch
#   x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu  (Vulkan)                    — P6, after launch

# --- Pinned, reproducible llama.cpp revision -------------------------------
# LLAMA_COMMIT is the pin. A git tag is a mutable pointer: upstream can delete
# and recreate it, and whoever owns that repo (or anyone who takes it over) can
# point b9949 at different code tomorrow. This script builds the binary that
# ships inside the installer and is code-signed with the app, so "whatever the
# tag names on the day CI runs" is not a supply chain we can stand behind.
# LLAMA_TAG stays as the readable name and as the cross-check: on every run,
# cache hit included, ensure_src asserts BOTH that HEAD is LLAMA_COMMIT and
# that the working tree carries no change against it, and the build stops if
# either fails.
#
# To bump, resolve the tag yourself and paste BOTH — llama.cpp tags are build
# numbers and upstream SKIPS numbers whose CI failed, so the tag must exist:
#   git ls-remote --tags https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp.git 'refs/tags/<tag>'
# CI reuses a cached checkout keyed on hashFiles('scripts/build-llama.sh')
# (release.yml, sidecar-windows.yml), so both values below are inside the cache
# key by construction — bumping one cannot silently reuse the old source tree.

# K1 (3.0.1): mac stays a single STATIC binary with Metal embedded. Apple
# Silicon has one relevant CPU family, so there is nothing to select at
# runtime and GGML_CPU_ALL_VARIANTS does not even claim ARM/Apple support for
# it (ggml/src/CMakeLists.txt only wires ALL_VARIANTS for x86, ARM/Android/
# PowerPC/s390x/riscv64, never "Apple x86_64" as a variant target; darwin
# stays out of that switch entirely).
#
# Windows and Linux (x86_64) switch to a DYNAMIC, multi-ISA build instead of
# one fixed x86-64-v3 binary. With GGML_NATIVE=OFF (unchanged, always was)
# and INS_ENB therefore ON, ggml/CMakeLists.txt:141-166 forces SSE4.2 + AVX +
# AVX2 + BMI2 + FMA + F16C into the ONE binary this script used to produce,
# any CPU older than Haswell/Excavator (2013+) gets 0xC000001D on Windows or
# SIGILL on Linux before llama-server can even log a line. Verified against
# the pinned llama.cpp checkout, not guessed:
#   GGML_BACKEND_DL=ON + GGML_CPU_ALL_VARIANTS=ON is the exact pair
#   ggml/src/CMakeLists.txt:371-376 requires (GGML_CPU_ALL_VARIANTS without
#   GGML_BACKEND_DL is a FATAL_ERROR there), and GGML_CPU_ALL_VARIANTS in turn
#   requires BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON (ggml/src/CMakeLists.txt:188-190, also a
#   FATAL_ERROR otherwise). Under MSVC this produces nine ggml-cpu-*.dll
#   variants (x64, sse42, sandybridge, haswell, skylakex, cannonlake,
#   cascadelake, icelake, alderlake (ggml/src/CMakeLists.txt:378-402); GCC on
#   Linux additionally gets ivybridge, piledriver, cooperlake, zen4 and
#   sapphirerapids (same block, the four "if (NOT MSVC)" branches). At
#   startup llama-server calls ggml_backend_load_all() (src/llama.cpp,
#   common/arg.cpp), which (per ggml/src/ggml-backend-reg.cpp:479-486)
#   scores every ggml-cpu-*.{dll,so} beside the executable and in the current
#   working directory and dlopen()s the best-scoring one for the CPU it is
#   actually running on. GGML_VULKAN stays on for both; it becomes a sibling
#   loadable backend (ggml-vulkan.dll/.so) the same way, discovered through
#   the identical search, so the GPU path is unaffected by this switch.
