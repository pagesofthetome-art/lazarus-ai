/**
 * Regression: when multiple local backends are detected on startup the user
 * used to see the BackendSelector modal without anything being pre-enabled.
 * If they skipped or dismissed the modal, LM Studio / vLLM / etc. stayed
 * disabled and their models never appeared in the chat model dropdown.
 *
 * Reported on Discord #help-chat (2026-04-21, user djoks.exe, "Lazarus does not
 * recognize the models"). Fix: always pre-enable the first non-Ollama
 * openai-compat backend that was detected, even when multiple are running.
 * The selector modal is kept as an educational picker so the user can still
 * change which one is primary.
 *
 * This test checks the source of AppShell.tsx for the fix pattern — we're
 * not mounting the full component, just guarding against a regression where
 * the 2+ branch silently does nothing.
