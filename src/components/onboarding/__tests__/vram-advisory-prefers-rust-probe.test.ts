/**
 * R2-51: the VRAM advisory on ModelsStep used to ask ONLY the running
 * ComfyUI's own /system_stats (`getSystemVRAM`, api/comfyui.ts). On this very
 * step, before ComfyUI has necessarily been started, that meant the memory
 * warning next to an oversized model was silent almost all the time, not
 * because the machine had enough VRAM, but because nothing had asked yet.
 *
 * `getMaxVramGb` (lib/hardware.ts) asks the Rust `detect_gpus` probe
 * (nvidia-smi/rocm-smi/lspci/wmic), which needs no engine running at all.
 * ComfyUI's own number stays the fallback for whatever `detect_gpus` could
 * not name (it fails soft to 0, which reads as "unknown", not "no VRAM").
 *
 * Source-level, matching the codebase's own pattern for a hook effect deep
 * inside a large component (see loop-stops-on-terminal.test.ts): what has to
 * hold is the call order, not a full render of a 500+ line step.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/components/onboarding/__tests__/vram-advisory-prefers-rust-probe.test.ts
