/**

 *
 * A14 (2.6.8), David: "es muss klar sein, ob der Ordner fuer LM Studio, Ollama
 * oder die Lazarus Engine gilt."
 *
 * Before this, Model Storage was one field labelled "(auto-detect)" over a
 * paragraph that named all three backends at once. A user setting that field
 * had no way to tell whose folder he was setting, and the honest answer is
 * that it is one backend's folder and not the other two's. It is three named
 * rows now: the field the user owns, the folder LM Studio owns, and Ollama,
 * which has no folder to set at all.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/components/settings/__tests__/model-storage-three-rows.test.ts
