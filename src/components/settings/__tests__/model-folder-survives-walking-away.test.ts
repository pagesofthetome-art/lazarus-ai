/**
 * @vitest-environment jsdom
 *
 * A16 (A14-2a), Windows counter-check 02.09.: the Lazarus Engine folder was stored
 * on Enter or on blur and on nothing else. Type a path and navigate away, and
 * the value stood in the box while `hfDownloadPathOverride` stayed empty,
 * Installed did not change, and a refresh did not help either. The
 * counter-check's first run concluded from that the folder was simply being
 * ignored. It is the reading anyone would reach, and a field that keeps
 * showing a value it never saved has earned it.
 *
 * The first answer to that was a 600 ms debounce beside the blur, and the
 * follow-up counter-check showed what it cost. The debounce stored the TRIMMED
 * value while the user was still typing, the store value flowed straight back
 * into the box, and a path with a space in it lost the space mid word:
 * "C:\Program " became "C:\Program" with the cursor at the end, and typing on
 * produced "C:\ProgramFiles". The same write sent a half typed path to the
 * folder scan, which answered with a red "unreachable" line under a field
 * nobody had finished filling in.
 *
 * No timer writes anything now. Blur, Enter and unmount commit, and the third
 * is what the original finding was about: walking away from a field IS a blur
 * or an unmount.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/components/settings/__tests__/model-folder-survives-walking-away.test.ts
