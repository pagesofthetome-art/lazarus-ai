/**
 * The AMD sentences the user reads, against what the app actually does.
 *
 * Befund 5d of the round 12 research (recherche-amd-rundum.md): three user
 * texts were still describing the app of before 2.6.7. Two of them were fixed
 * in round 12 with the code that made them wrong; these are the leftovers.
 *
 *   src/components/settings/HardwareSettings.tsx:227
 *   "Lazarus installs an NVIDIA / CPU ComfyUI by default"
 *
 * That has not been true since 57196b31 on Linux and since 6d5dc61e on
 * Windows, and it sends an AMD owner looking for a ComfyUI of his own that the
 * app has already installed for him. The DirectML pointer next to it is stale
 * in its own right: torch-directml has had no release since 2024-09-15, pins
 * torch 2.4.1, and is in Microsoft's declared maintenance mode.
 *
 * The same stale claim sat in the Create tab's CPU banner, on the Windows half
 * ("PyTorch ships no ROCm wheels for Windows, so this card needs a DirectML or
 * ZLUDA ComfyUI of your own"), which is the very sentence the research
 * disproved. It is fixed here with its twin, because leaving one of two
 * identical false sentences standing is not a smaller change, it is a worse
 * one.
 *
 * The copy is pinned against the switch that decides, so the two cannot drift
 * apart again in silence.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/components/settings/__tests__/amd-copy-is-current.test.ts
