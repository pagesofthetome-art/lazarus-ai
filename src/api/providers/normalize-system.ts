/**
 * One system message, and it sits first. Enforced on the last piece of code
 * every request passes through, right before the body is serialized.
 *
 * Why this exists (bug B3, 2.6.7). Discord #bug-reports 2026-08-21:
 * helpslowlydying diagnosed it as "the system instructions or tools are being
 * injected in the wrong order, causing the Jinja template engine to crash with
 * System message must be at the beginning", and platorius, who was hitting it,
 * added "the problem is only in Lazarus" with the same model and the same prompts
 * working in other frontends.
 *
 * That is exactly what a strict Jinja chat template does. llama.cpp
 * (llama-server, the built-in engine) and LM Studio render the model's own
 * template, and the Qwen, Mistral and ChatML style templates shipped with many
 * GGUFs contain a literal
 *
 *   {{ raise_exception('System message must be at the beginning') }}
 *
 * guard that fires on ANY message with role "system" at an index other than 0,
 * and several of them fire on a SECOND system message even when both sit at the
 * front. The request never reaches the model, so nothing partial streams: the
 * turn just dies.
 *
 * 2.6.6 fixed one producer (the compaction trim notice, see
 * lib/__tests__/compaction-system-position.test.ts). This is the other half of
 * the job: instead of auditing every one of the dozen places that assemble a
 * message array, the invariant is checked once on the way out. A payload that
 * already satisfies it is returned BY REFERENCE, untouched, so the upstream
 * prefix cache still matches byte for byte and the normal path pays nothing.
 *
 * Merging rather than dropping is deliberate. Every system message in the array
 * is an instruction someone meant the model to follow (a persona, a tool
 * catalog, a memory block, an injected context header). Dropping the late ones
 * would silently disarm a feature; merging them into the leading system message
 * in their original order keeps every instruction and keeps the order the
 * builders intended.

 * is the overwhelmingly common case: zero system messages, or exactly one at
 * index 0. Only a payload that would have crashed a strict template is rebuilt.
 *
 * Notes on the merge:
 *   - Content order follows the array order, so the leading system prompt stays
 *     the leading text and a later injection is appended behind it.
 *   - Empty and whitespace-only system parts are dropped. If that leaves
 *     nothing, the system message disappears entirely instead of going out as
 *     an empty one, which some templates also refuse.
 *   - Fields other than `content` are taken from the FIRST system message
 *     (that is the one carrying the real prompt), so nothing a provider adds
 *     to its own wire shape is lost.
 *   - Non-system messages keep their order and their identity untouched.

// ══ The template contract (bug B3, round 2) ════════════════════
//
// The counter-check ran the round-1 fix against a real strict template
// (Gemma 3, whose Jinja raises on every rule it can check) on the installed
// 2.6.7 build, and the crash was still reachable three ways. One system
// message at the front was necessary and nowhere near sufficient:
//
//   1. Agent turn with tools. After the first tool result the wire carried
//      [system, user, assistant, tool] and NO `tools` field, because the run
//      was on the prompt transport. The template has no branch for a `tool`
//      role, so it raised and the next round died.
//   2. Plain chat. The chat tools (web_search and friends) are on by default,
//      so an ordinary question produced the very same four roles and the very
//      same death, with no agent mode anywhere in sight.
//   3. Group chat. From round two on, the history holds two assistant
//      messages in a row (one per speaker), and the template demands strict
//      user/assistant alternation. Both speakers died.
//
// The same payloads run on Hermes 3, whose ChatML template loops over the
// messages and renders whatever it is handed. So the request shape is not
// wrong in the abstract: it is wrong for the template that has to render it.
//
// Hence a CONTRACT rather than one more rule. Where the model's own template
// does the rendering, the wire gets a sequence every template can render:
// no `tool` role, no two turns of the same role in a row, and a user turn
// first. Where the SERVER implements the protocol (a cloud endpoint) or has
// declared its template understands tools (the run then carries a native
// `tools` payload), nothing is rewritten and the tool calls stay native.
//
// Why the tolerant sequence rather than a per-template capability probe: the
// engine does publish its template on /props, but reading a Jinja source and
// deciding what it will accept is guesswork, the answer is cached and can be
// a model swap out of date, and being wrong means a dead turn. The tolerant
// sequence also renders correctly on a tolerant template, so the cost of
// choosing it when it was not needed is a slightly wordier prompt, and the
// cost of the other mistake is a chat that cannot be used at all.
