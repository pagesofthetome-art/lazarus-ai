/**
 * Retry for the one class of failure a second attempt actually fixes: the
 * server said "not now".
 *
 * Today a 429 or a 503 reaches the user as the raw status line, even though
 * nothing is wrong with the request — a burst limiter is holding the door for
 * a second or a gateway is between upstreams. Retrying that is free; retrying
 * anything else is not, so the rules are narrow on purpose:
 *
 *  - Only the transient statuses below. A 4xx that describes the request is
 *    deterministic and must surface immediately.
 *  - Only around the REQUEST, never around a body loop. Once bytes are
 *    flowing a retry would replay half an answer, so this wraps the call that
 *    produces the Response and hands the untouched Response straight back the
 *    moment the status is not retryable. The stream is consumed by the caller,
 *    after this returns.
 *  - Abortable. Stop during a backoff ends the wait and the walk.
 *
 * Deliberately capped short: the agent loop already has its own retry ladder
 * (lib/http-status retryDelayMs + useAgentChat's announceWait) which can sit
 * out a full minute BECAUSE it tells the user it is waiting. Nothing here can
 * say anything, so a wait longer than MAX_SILENT_RETRY_WAIT_MS is worse than
 * the honest error — we return the refusal and let the layer that can speak
 * decide.
