/**
 * The one bolt in front of the Lazarus Engine model swap.
 *
 * A14 fourth review: the bolt existed but it was a module variable inside
 * `useModels`, so it held the Installed card and nothing else. The composer's
 * picker calls `activateBuiltinModel` itself and guards it with its own
 * component state, which knows nothing about the card. Two doors into one
 * llama-server, and the second swap lands on a process the first is still
 * restarting, which is the ENG-4 crash from the side the ENG-4 fix never
 * covered.
 *
 * The behaviour across the two real doors is proven in
 * hooks/__tests__/installed-card-click-switches-the-backend.test.ts. What is
 * proven here is the bolt itself, including the one thing no caller can prove:
 * that a swap which never answers cannot lock the model list until the app is
 * restarted.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/api/__tests__/lazarus-engine-swap-lock.test.ts
