 * relicensed forward into v3, and a source-available licence (SSPL, Commons
 * Clause, "UNLICENSED") is not free software at all.
 *
 * A dependency bump is exactly how such a licence arrives: nobody reads the
 * new transitive tree. This reads package-lock.json, which records a licence
 * per resolved package, so the check is offline and exact about the versions
 * that actually install.
