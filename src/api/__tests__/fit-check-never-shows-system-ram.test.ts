 *
 * A5, GitHub #123 (Zhorts, 2026-09-01, Windows 11, RX 9070 XT, 64 GB RAM).
 *
 * The Model Manager fit check read "62 GB GPU · 62 GB RAM": the same number
 * twice, on a machine with a 16 GB card, while the Settings page one tab away
 * had the correct 16 GB. Two probes feed that chip and DiscoverModels keeps the
 * LARGER of the two, so one wrong number is enough to win.
 *
 * The wrong number came from ComfyUI. Without a usable GPU backend, and no ROCm
 * was detected on that box, ComfyUI still reports one device in /system_stats:
 * the CPU one, whose `vram_total` is `psutil.virtual_memory().total`. It is
 * system RAM in a field called vram_total, and `devices[0].vram_total` took it.
 *
 * The rule this file pins: system RAM never appears as VRAM, and where nothing
 * measured the GPU the answer is the word "unknown", not a number. A fit check
 * that admits it does not know is one a user can still act on. One that says
 * 62 GB sends him to download a model his card cannot hold.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/api/__tests__/fit-check-never-shows-system-ram.test.ts
