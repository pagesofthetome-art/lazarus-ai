/**
 * K2 (mrvideogame9829/sockenmonster, Discord "HELP WITH MODELS"/help-18,
 * and GH #128-adjacent reports after the 3.0 update): "Prompt outputs failed
 * validation | Node 3 (VAELoader): Value not in list" on Lipsync/Animate.
 *
 * A `params.vae` override (a stale remembered pick from an older Lazarus/ComfyUI
 * install, a wrong path separator, a subfolder-qualified name, ...) used to
 * go straight into the VAELoader node unchecked. buildDynamicWorkflow now
 * validates it against `models.vaes`, the live VAELoader enum already read
 * off the same /object_info response this build used for strategy detection,
 * BEFORE writing the node, and throws an actionable WorkflowUnavailableError
 * instead of letting ComfyUI's opaque "Value not in list" reach the user.
 *
 * review-create.md nachbessert, Punkt 3: a plain `models.vaes.includes()`
 * blocked a file that really IS installed whenever the remembered spelling
 * differed cosmetically (backslash instead of slash, a leftover subfolder
 * prefix, different case) from the live enum's own spelling. The check now
 * normalizes first (normalizeLoaderValue in dynamic-workflow.ts) and, on a
 * match, writes the LIVE enum's spelling to the node, not the remembered
 * one, so an existing file never blocks the run. Only a genuine miss throws.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/api/__tests__/vae-override-live-check-k2.test.ts
