/**
 * Runs a single function out of `mobile-client/client.js` — the shipped one.
 *
 * ── Why this exists at all ──
 *
 * T-75 pulled the mobile client out of a Rust string. Most of its brain moved
 * into three real ES modules (`caveman.js`, `personas.js`, `agent-core.js`)
 * that tests simply `import`, and that is what you should reach for. This
 * helper is for the rest: functions that live in `client.js`, the 2 100-line
 * shell that touches `document`, `fetch` and `localStorage` on the first line
 * and therefore cannot be imported into a Node test.
 *
 * Two of them are worth testing anyway, because they decide what the model is
 * told rather than what the screen shows: `buildSystemPrompt` and the client's
 * own `isThinkingCompatible`. Both are pure once their surroundings are
 * supplied. So: cut the declaration out by name, evaluate it with the names it
 * refers to passed in, and run the real body.
 *
 * ── What this is NOT ──
 *
 * It is not the old pattern coming back in. What T-75 removed was a
 * hand-written TypeScript re-implementation of `buildSystemPrompt` sitting
 * next to the real one and being tested instead of it — two copies, one
 * maintained. This runs the shipped bytes. It is weaker than an import in
 * exactly one way, and the way is named and guarded: it locates a declaration
 * by name in a real `.js` file, and if the name is gone it throws instead of
 * quietly testing nothing.
 *
 * The reason `buildSystemPrompt` cannot simply be exported is worth writing
 * down, because "just move it too" is the obvious next thought: it reads
 * `chats`, `currentChatId` and `dispatchedSystemPrompt`, which `client.js`
 * ASSIGNS to. An ES module binding is read-only in the importer, so those
 * variables have to stay in the file that mutates them, and everything that
 * closes over them stays with them.

/**
 * One of the client's source files with its COMMENTS removed.
 *
 * Needed because the reasons in this repository name the things they replaced:
 * the note above `monogram()` in client.js and the one above the sprite in
 * index.html both spell out `/Lazarus-monogram-white.png`, and a guard that greps
 * for that string would fire on the explanation of why it is gone.
 *
 * The stripping is deliberately LINE-BASED and not the usual pair of regexes.
 * `src.replace(/\/\*[\s\S]*?\*\//g, '')` was tried first and ate 400 lines of
 * client.js in one bite: the file contains `/*` inside ordinary JavaScript
 * strings (a prompt, a regex), so the "block" it found ran from a string to
 * whatever `*` + `/` came next. Dropping whole comment LINES cannot do that —
 * a line that begins with `//`, `/*` or a continuation `*` is a comment line
 * in all four of these files, and nothing else is touched. HTML comments are
 * the one multi-line form that is removed as a block, because `<!--` cannot
 * appear inside an HTML attribute or a CSS value.
