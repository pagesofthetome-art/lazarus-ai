/**
 * C8, the third path: the install click.
 *
 * Create waits for ComfyUI's directory scan (2.6.5) and the Model Manager's
 * download poller waits too (2.6.6). installBundleComplete did not. It asked
 * ComfyUI once, cached the answer, and judged every file that check_model_sizes
 * reported as complete on disk from that single lookup. In the C8 window, the
 * seconds after a big download lands while ComfyUI is still scanning, the
 * answer for a file that is perfectly fine is "not listed", and the video
 * bundles share files, so starting an overlapping bundle right after one
 * finished produced a red row claiming Lazarus and ComfyUI use different model
 * folders. They do not. The scan was simply still running.
 *
 * The budget inside the click is deliberately short, three rounds against the
 * other two paths' twenty, because it runs inside a click and an old file
 * answers on the first lookup with no waiting at all.
 *
 * D2, 2.6.7: those three rounds are a fast path, not the verdict. 05ee25ff
 * justified them with "the download poller keeps watching the same file with
 * the full budget", which is not true for a file the install SKIPPED because it
 * was already on disk: no transfer is started, so nothing ever reaches the
 * poller. Anything the click cannot confirm now goes to a background
 * confirmation on the full budget, and the click meanwhile announces the one
 * thing that is certain, that the file is on disk.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/api/__tests__/bundle-install-visible-wait.test.ts
