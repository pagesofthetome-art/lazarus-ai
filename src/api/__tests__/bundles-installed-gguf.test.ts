/**
 * GH #113, second half: the installed check has to know the GGUF loader.
 *
 * checkBundlesInstalled confirms its disk verdict against the running
 * ComfyUI, so a bundle that sits in a folder ComfyUI does not read cannot
 * claim to be installed (pnwpdr4519). It built that visible-set from
 * checkpoints, diffusion_models, vae and text_encoders, and UNETLoader only
 * enumerates .safetensors and .sft. GGUF quants are listed by ComfyUI-GGUF's
 * own loader, which the Create probe learned in b8531b6 and this one did not.
 *
 * Both Unfiltered video bundles are GGUF (NSFW Wan 14B, Wan 2.2 Rapid AIO),
 * which is the "unfiltered models doesn't shown as installed" in the title.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/api/__tests__/bundles-installed-gguf.test.ts
