/**
 * T-53, second half — nothing disconnected the external MCP servers when the
 * app went away, so their child processes were left behind.
 *
 * ── What already cleans up, and what does not ────────────────────────────
 *
 * `AppState::shutdown_subprocesses()` (`src-tauri/src/state.rs`) kills the
 * children RUST spawned and tracks in AppState: the Cloudflare quick tunnel,
 * Ollama, ComfyUI, the bundled llama-server and embeddings server, the MLX
 * video subprocess and image sidecar, the LoRA trainer, the installer child
 * trees, whisper. External MCP
 * servers are none of those — they are spawned from the frontend through
 * `@tauri-apps/plugin-shell`, land in the PLUGIN's child map, and never appear
 * in AppState. So this file does not duplicate that function; the two have an
 * empty intersection.
 *
 * The overlap that does exist is with the shell plugin itself:
 * `tauri-plugin-shell` 2.3.5 sweeps its own child map on `RunEvent::Exit`
 * (`src/lib.rs:132-143`) and kills every child. That covers the packaged app's
 * real quit paths — tray Quit, `exit_app`, Cmd+Q — and it is not double work,
 * because the JS `kill()` we issue below goes through the plugin's own
 * `kill` command, which REMOVES the pid from that same map before killing it
 * (`src/commands.rs:300-309`). Whoever gets there first takes the entry; the
 * other finds nothing. One registry, one kill.
 *
 * ── Why the trigger is page unload and NOT onCloseRequested ──────────────
 *
 * The obvious Tauri hook is the wrong one here. In this app the window's X
 * does not quit: `main.rs:549` calls `api.prevent_close()` and hides to the
 * tray, deliberately, and the window comes back with Show. Hanging the MCP
 * teardown off `onCloseRequested` would kill every connected server every time
 * the user pressed X and expected the app to keep standing.
 *
 * What no layer covers is the WEBVIEW going away without the process going
 * away: a `tauri dev` HMR full reload, a `location.reload()`, the recovery
 * path in `main.tsx`. The plugin's Exit sweep does not fire, and the JS side
 * loses the only handle to those processes (the client map is module state),
 * so they stay resident with nobody able to reach them for the rest of the
 * app's life. That is the orphan this file exists for.
 *
 * And it is ONE path, not one per mode. `pagehide` and `beforeunload` are two
 * TRIGGERS for the same single implementation
 * (`disconnectAllExternalServers`), registered identically whether the app is
 * running packaged or under `npm run dev`; both fire in a browser and in the
 * WKWebView/WebView2 the packaged app uses. Under plain `npm run dev` there is
 * no Tauri IPC, so no MCP server can have been spawned at all and the sweep
 * finds an empty set — the same code doing nothing, rather than a second code
 * path that only one mode has.
 *
 * ── What this cannot promise ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The kill is an async IPC call. An unload handler cannot await, so the request
 * is posted and the page goes away; the Rust side normally receives it because
 * the post is synchronous, but nothing here can prove the process was reaped.
 *
 * The tree kill this paragraph used to call out of reach is not: `c5773322`
 * added `process_util::kill_pid_tree` and `4c7bf748` put a `kill_process_tree`
 * command in front of it, guarded by `may_kill_pid` so only this app's own
 * subtree can be addressed. `external-client.ts` calls it in
 * `killServerProcess` INSTEAD of the plugin's `child.kill()` — never after,
 * because the direct child's death reparents its children to init and the
 * guard then (correctly) refuses. So the `npx -y some-mcp-server` case, where
 * the launcher is the direct child and the real `node` server is a grandchild,
 * is covered on the path this file drives.
 *
 * What remains unpromised is the fallback: outside Tauri, against a Rust side
 * older than `c5773322`, or when the guard refuses because the process already
 * exited on its own, `external-client.ts` falls back to the plugin's kill of
 * the DIRECT child and logs that it did. That kill is one signal to one
 * process (`tauri-plugin-shell` 2.3.5, `src/process/mod.rs:78`), so a server
 * that forked its own processes can still leave them behind there.
