/**
 * Can this machine embed a document right now, and WHERE would the text go.
 *
 * One question, one answer, for every surface that needs it: the RAG upload
 * pre-flight (hooks/useRAG), the RAG panel's install card and privacy line, and
 * the Docs button in the composer (hooks/useEmbedLane). It lived inside useRAG
 * before A9, which is why the composer could not ask it and hid the button on
 * the embedding lane instead.
 *
 * It asks the lane that will ACTUALLY run (api/rag.ts routes the same way):
 * the bundled embeddings server whenever it is up or the built-in engine is the
 * backend, Ollama otherwise. Asking Ollama on a built-in-engine box was the
 * 2026-08-15 bug. Ollama had nomic-embed-text pulled, the bundled lane had no
 * embedding GGUF at all, and nobody asked the lane that ran.
 *
 * The lane, not just a yes/no, because the honest sentence depends on it.
 * Ollama's base URL is user-configurable (GUI `set_ollama_host`, or OLLAMA_HOST
 * at startup), so "your documents stay on this computer" is simply false when
 * the user pointed Lazarus at a LAN box: indexing sends EVERY chunk of every
 * document to that host, not just the passages that match a question. Review
 * finding B2, 2026-09-02.
 *
 * The embeddings server is a local sidecar and resumes with the app
 * (useModels.resumeEmbedServer).
