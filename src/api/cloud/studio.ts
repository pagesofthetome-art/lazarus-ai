 * only this call's number is what the server will actually charge, and
 * booking against a guessed one risks a 409 after the customer already
 * pressed start (Portplan Abschnitt 4/7, Risiko 1+2).
 *
 * Two failure shapes both mean "this server does not have Studio yet", and
 * both get the same honest, English text instead of a technical one:
 *  - a plain 404 (the route answered, CORS present, but no handler, a
 *    server that shipped P0's CORS fix without this route existing yet), and
 *  - a raw network/CORS failure (the route has no `withCors`/`OPTIONS` at
 *    all, the browser never lets the response reach this code; the
 *    documented pre-P0 state of both routes today). cloudFetch already turns
 *    that into its own CloudJobError(status 0, "Could not reach the Lazarus
 *    Cloud server...") for every OTHER cloud call; here it is reworded once
 *    more, because "try again in a moment" reads as a blip and this is a
 *    version gap. Any other rejection (401 not signed in, 408 timeout, a
 *    deliberate abort) is not a version gap and keeps its own status intact.
