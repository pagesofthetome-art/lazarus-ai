/**
 * Model-Picker gate (v2.5.3). Runs inside executeImageGenerate /
 * executeVideoGenerate BEFORE vramHandoffGenerate — i.e. before the VRAM
 * swap — and returns the model name the generation should use, or null to
 * leave the existing auto-selection untouched. The pick is OURS (Lazarus UI),
 * not the LLM's:
 *
 *   - explicit `model` arg from the user/LLM   → no picker (intent wins)
 *   - Create tab selection installed           → silent use (the user's
 *     visible model choice in the product, see chooseFromUserSelection)
 *   - saved preference installed               → silent use (Change-Model
 *     affordance shows in the tool call instead)
 *   - nothing chosen anywhere (or it got uninstalled) → ModelPickerCard
 *     renders in the running tool call; save icon persists the choice
 *   - ComfyUI unreachable / no models          → null (the existing decide
 *     phase reports its own actionable error — UX identical to before)
 *
 * Model filtering mirrors vram-handoff's decide phase exactly: image =
 * getImageModels; video splits by inputImage into I2V (isI2VModel) vs T2V
 * (the rest). The preference keys are per-kind because the sets are
 * disjoint (SVD can't T2V, Wan 1.3B can't I2V).

/**
 * The model the user has ALREADY chosen for this kind, in order of authority,

 *
 * The Create tab comes first. It is the model selection the user can see and
 * changed last, so a Create tab set to Z-Image has to answer a chat request
 * for a picture with Z-Image. Nebenbefund N1 of the D1 counter-check (Windows
 * build, 2026-08-29): with an empty `model` argument the chat tool ignored
 * that and built a Realistic Vision graph in two runs out of two, because the
 * saved picker preference was the only choice this gate ever read.
 *
 * `saved` (the ModelPickerCard preference) stays as the second source, so an
 * install that never opened Create behaves exactly as before. Both have to be
 * in `names`, the installed and eligible set for THIS call: an uninstalled or
 * wrong-capability choice falls through to the picker instead of building a
 * graph around a file ComfyUI does not have.
