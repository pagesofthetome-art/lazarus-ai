/**
 * Restart ComfyUI so a freshly installed node pack registers, because packs
 * only load at startup.
 *
 * `stop_comfyui` can only kill the ComfyUI that Lazarus itself spawned. Started from
 * a terminal, a batch file or ComfyUI Desktop, the old process keeps the port
 * and keeps serving its old node list, while the process Lazarus starts next never
 * gets the port at all. Everything downstream then looks like a broken install:
 * the connection check says the engine is up, the node is still missing, and
 * the user is sent to hunt an IMPORT FAILED line that was never written,
 * because that process never tried the import.
 *
 * Measured on the test box on 2026-08-15: two python.exe alive, VHS_VideoCombine
 * installed on disk and absent from the answering /object_info, no import error
 * anywhere in the log. Killing both and starting once listed all 40 VHS nodes.
 *
 * So: stop, then confirm the port actually went quiet before starting again.
 * Whatever still answers after that is an engine Lazarus does not own, and the only
 * honest thing to do is say so.
