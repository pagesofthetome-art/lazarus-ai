/**
 * Command injection regression, found in the 2.5.9 security pass (2026-07-26)
 * and reproduced live on Windows before the fix.
 *
 * Two holes, both reachable from a prompt injection (a poisoned file, PR
 * comment or search result steering the model into one tool call) and neither
 * covered by a gate: `pr_resume` is in neither CODEX_CONFIRM_TOOLS nor
 * MUTATING_TOOLS, and the git tools are in MUTATING_TOOLS but not in the
 * confirm gate, so none of them stops for a dialog.
 *
 *   A) shellQuote escaped for POSIX only. shell_execute_sync runs PowerShell on
 *      Windows, where `'\''` ENDS the string, so the rest ran as script:
 *        Write-Output 'x'\''; Write-Output SHELLQUOTE-INJECTED; '\'''
 *      printed SHELLQUOTE-INJECTED on its own line.
 *   B) PR_URL_RE accepted `[^/]+` for owner and repo, so
 *        https://github.com/o/r;Write-Output PRRESUME-INJECTED/pull/1
 *      built `gh pr view 1 --repo o/r;Write-Output PRRESUME-INJECTED --json …`
 *      and the payload ran.
