/**
 * Phase 5 (v2.4.0) — Side-effect key derivation.
 *
 * When a ReAct turn emits multiple tool calls, we want to run them
 * concurrently for speed, BUT two calls that touch the same shared
 * resource must be serialized. The scheduler groups calls by
 * sideEffectKey and runs one group in parallel but within-group in
 * sequence.
 *
 *   - Pure reads (file_read, web_fetch, web_search, file_list,
 *     file_search, screenshot) → no key (fully parallel-safe).
 *
 *   - file_write, file_edit → key is `file_write:<normalized-path>`. Two
 *     mutations of the SAME path serialize; mutations of DIFFERENT paths
 *     remain parallel. The `file_write:` prefix is a shared namespace for
 *     "something rewrites this file", not the tool name: keys are compared as
 *     plain strings across tools (tool-executor groups by the key alone), so
 *     file_write + file_edit on one path land in one serial group — which is
 *     what we want, since an edit's old_string match depends on whatever the
 *     write left behind.
 *
 *     file_edit used to fall through to `default` and therefore ran keyless.
 *     Two edits of the same file in one batch (the normal shape of a refactor
 *     round) then ran concurrently on a read-modify-write: last writer won,
 *     the other edit was lost silently, and BOTH reported success. In Stage
 *     mode the user reviewed a queue that was missing an approved change.
 *
 *   - shell_execute → key 'exec'. We do not know what a shell command
 *     touches, and concurrent repo writes race on `.git/index.lock`, so all
 *     shell calls share a single queue. (Since the 2.6.6 merge the shell IS
 *     git, tests and background starts, so this one case covers them all.)
 *
 *   - image_generate, video_generate, run_workflow → key 'comfyui'. ComfyUI
 *     serializes internally and workflows do heavy I/O; running in parallel
 *     provides no win and competes for the GPU + the VRAM hand-off.
