/**
 * @vitest-environment jsdom
 *
 * Review B1, second half: the Docs button now always opens the RAG panel, and
 * the panel's install card is the only thing in the app that can give a user an
 * embedding lane from inside a chat. That card therefore has to work on every
 * box it can be reached from.
 *
 * It did not. `pullEmbeddingModel` sent everyone who is not on the managed
 * built-in engine to `ollama pull`. On a box with LM Studio, a plain
 * openai-compat backend, or nothing but retired hosted service, there is no Ollama to pull
 * from, so the card spun and changed nothing. The bundled GGUF is the lane
 * api/rag.ts would take there anyway, so that is where the install goes.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/hooks/__tests__/the-install-card-has-a-working-path.test.ts
