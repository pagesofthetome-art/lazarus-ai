// ─── A request the server's context could not hold ───
//
// GH #140 (Code Agent, /loop): long runs ended pass after pass on HTTP 400
// "the request exceeds the available context size" and never compacted. Lazarus
// sizes each step against the window it resolved for the model, estimated at
// four characters a token, and the tool catalogue rides on top of that. When
// the server holds less (a model loaded with a smaller context than it was
// trained for, a tokenizer that packs code denser than four characters), every
// step was refused the same way, and the loop fired the same refusal again on
// the next pass.
//
// The refusal names the numbers more often than not. This reads them, and the
// step goes out again with the history cut to a budget that fits, instead of
// ending the pass. The budget is remembered for the model and the window it
// runs with, so the next step and the next pass start inside it.
