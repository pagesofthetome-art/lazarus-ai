/**
 * The folder under Settings → Model Storage, handed to ComfyUI.
 *
 * GH #122 (zrmdsxa) and the Discord thread "Read me first" (ever.noob) are one
 * folder apart: a chat GGUF in a folder of your own, and a LoRA in one. The
 * GGUF side is ours: `list_bundled_models` scans the folder now. The LoRA
 * side is not: Lazarus never reads image or video models off the disk, that
 * inventory comes out of ComfyUI's `/object_info` enums, and ComfyUI lists
 * only what sits under its own models tree.
 *
 * So this is the handover. Rust writes ComfyUI's own extra-model-paths file
 * for the ComfyUI-shaped subfolders it finds and passes it at start; a
 * hand written `extra_model_paths.yaml` in the user's ComfyUI folder is never
 * touched. One limit is real and the Settings copy names it: only a ComfyUI
 * that Lazarus starts is handed the folder. The subfolders are scanned again on
 * every one of those starts, so a subfolder added later arrives with the next
 * start.
