/**
 * The port the managed built-in engine actually runs on, and the base URL the
 * `openai` slot has to carry so requests reach it.
 *
 * GH #118 (nayffy, 2026-08-27, Windows 11): the engine port was a constant in
 * two places, `http://127.0.0.1:8127/v1` in the provider slot and 8127 in Rust,
 * and nothing could move. Since the Rust side may now take the next free port
 * when 8127 is held (a leftover llama-server, or one of the port ranges Windows
 * reserves for Hyper-V and WSL), the slot has to follow it. A slot pointing at
 * the old port would produce exactly the symptom the ticket describes, a
 * refused connection to a server that is up and healthy one port away.
 *
 * Pure on purpose, and deliberately narrow: only a LOOPBACK base URL is ever
 * rewritten. The same slot can hold LM Studio or a remote OpenAI-compatible
 * server the user configured, and moving somebody else's port would be a much
 * worse bug than the one this fixes.
