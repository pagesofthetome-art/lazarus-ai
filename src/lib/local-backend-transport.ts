/**
 * One reading of "the backend did not answer", shared by every provider that
 * reaches its server through the Rust proxy: on this machine, on the LAN, or
 * on a host of the user's own out on the internet.
 *
 * The Rust proxy hands a refused connection back as
 * `Response(503, {"error": "proxy_localhost_stream_chunked: error sending
 * request for url (http://127.0.0.1:8127/v1/chat/completions)"})`. That text
 * names a Rust command and a port and tells the user nothing they can act on,
 * so no provider may put it in a chat bubble. Until 04.09.2026 nobody had to:
 * the proxy's end-of-stream marker won the race against the rejection and the
 * chat said "the connection dropped, check your network" instead, which was
 * worse, because it was wrong. With that race closed (see proxy.rs) the real
 * message arrives, and every provider needs the same two answers about it:
 * is this a transport failure against MY host, and what do I say instead.
 *
 * The second answer splits by where that host is, so there are two sentences
 * below and not one. `localBackendUnreachableMessage` talks to somebody who
 * runs the server himself and can start it; `remoteBackendUnreachableMessage`
 * talks to somebody whose address may simply be wrong or whose line may be
 * down. The first question, `isLocalTransportFailure`, is the same for both.

 * True when `message` is a transport failure against `baseUrl`'s host.
 *
 * Three halves, and each one earned its place. Without the pattern check a real
 * HTTP error from the server would be swallowed and replaced by our guess.
 * Without the hostname check a failure against a different machine would be
 * blamed on this one. And without the port check, the two servers people
 * actually run side by side on 127.0.0.1, our engine on 8127 and Ollama on
 * 11434, are indistinguishable: whoever could not reach one was told to restart
 * the other.
 *
 * The port is optional, the hostname is not. `ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1` names a
 * host and no port and still lands. A bare `Failed to fetch` names neither and
 * is turned down on purpose: a server may use those same words about a file it
 * could not read, and swallowing that would replace its own answer with a
 * sentence about a machine that is in fact running. So everything we produce
 * ourselves names the address it failed on, see both fallbacks in
 * `localFetchStream` (api/backend.ts).
