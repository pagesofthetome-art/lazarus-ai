 * chats after a restart??", then "My code chats are vaporised".
 *
 * Lazarus keeps chat-conversations and locally-uncensored-memory in IndexedDB
 * (2.5.0, the 5 MB localStorage cap could not hold a real history) and every
 * other store in localStorage. Those are different storage layers with
 * different lifetimes: a hard process kill mid write, which is what a self
 * update does, can leave Chromium discarding the whole IndexedDB database on
 * the next start while localStorage comes back untouched.
 *
 * AppShell's restore only ever asked localStorage. On that boot every
 * localStorage store answers, so it took the quiet branch, restored RAG chunks
 * and returned. Nothing looked at IndexedDB, so the chats stayed gone with a
 * good copy of them sitting in store_backup.json the whole time.
 *
 * Pure so the decision can be proven without a webview: the caller reads the
 * live stores and the backup, this says what to write back.
