 * that has no sidecar and will never have one, and wrong for the moment this
 * actually runs: right after launch, with the antivirus still scanning the
 * fresh install and the Tauri command layer coming up behind the window. A
 * first call that loses that race used to spend the only shot, and the engine
 * the user left running yesterday stayed dead until he re-picked the model by
 * hand. That is GH #118 again, one door further along.
 *
 * So the shot is spent on an ANSWER, and a refusal counts as one: a backend
 * that says "I do not have that command" has answered, and waiting will not
 * change its mind. A timeout or a dead transport has said nothing at all.
