 * breath. Nothing on screen said which of the three the folder you were about
 * to pick actually belonged to, and the honest answer is that it belongs to
 * exactly one of them. So the panel is three rows now, each with a name, a
 * path and a role, and the rules for what each row prints live here where they

 * asking whether the app detects something, he is asking which folder is being
 * read while the field is empty, and the app knows that folder: it is row 0 of
 * the last listing, the app's own models dir.
 *
 * A14 review 4: it is named for what it IS, not as an "auto" anything. There
 * is no detection going on and nothing is derived from the active provider;
 * an empty field simply means Lazarus uses the folder it owns. Saying "auto" there
 * next to a paragraph about four folder levels invited the reading that the
 * four levels apply to this folder, and they do not: the app folder is walked
 * two levels deep (MAX_SCAN_DEPTH), the folder the user names four
 * (MAX_CUSTOM_SCAN_DEPTH). The paragraph carries both depths now, so this one
 * only has to name the folder.
