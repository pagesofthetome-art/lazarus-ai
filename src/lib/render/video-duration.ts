// needs a length list, and a length the catalog just added that the static
// file has not caught up with yet must still show and still book. This is
// the ONE place both the picker (Composer's LaneControls) and the booking
// (useCloudCreate, PresetWorkshop) read from now. Round 1 had the picker
// read this order and the booking read `videoDurations()` alone, so a length
// the catalog named but the JSON notvorrat did not know silently booked a
// shorter clip than the one shown and priced (review-studio-A.md B2).
