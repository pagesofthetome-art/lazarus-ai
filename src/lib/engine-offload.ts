/**
 * Where the Lazarus Engine actually computes, said out loud.
 *
 * Commit ccdc2d14 (3.0.0, bugs u and a) taught the engine two things: to
 * measure free graphics memory and buy a layer count with it instead of
 * demanding all of them, and to run the SECOND start attempt on the processor
 * when the first one died with layers on the card. Both are real repairs and
 * neither had a surface. `start_bundled_engine` answered `cpuOnly: true` once,
 * in the return value of the call that started it, and every caller read
 * `.port` out of that object and dropped the rest on the floor. The layer
 * count existed only inside the argv and the log file.
 *
 * So a user whose card could not hold the model got exactly what the reports
 * described before the fix, minus the crash: an engine that looks ordinary,
 * says nothing, and answers at a tenth of the speed. "Why is it suddenly slow"
 * had no answer anywhere in the window.
 *
 * Two statements, because the two facts have different lifetimes:
 *
 *   - the fallback is an EVENT. It happened at a moment, to this engine, and
 *     the user has something to do about it (read the log, close whatever is
 *     holding the card, pick a smaller model). It goes to the standing line
 *     above the composer, once per engine.
 *   - the layer count is a CONDITION. It stays true for as long as the process
 *     runs, so it belongs where the app already says which model, which
 *     context and which port: the Built-in Engine panel in Settings.
 *
 * Quiet tone for both. lib/hinweis.ts allows exactly two, and this is not an
 * error: the engine is serving, the chat works, it is slower than it could be.
