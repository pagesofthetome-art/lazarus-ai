/**
 * The sentence the Create tab shows while ComfyUI is rendering on the processor.
 *
 * Nebenbefund 1 of the R12/R13 re-measure on the real 2.6.7 Windows build
 * (2026-08-30, ergebnis-r1213-nachmessung.md):
 *
 *   "Der Klammergrund im CPU-Band ist bei Force CPU falsch. (no usable GPU
 *    detected) bei erkannter und funktionierender RTX 3060."
 *
 * The banner had exactly one text for two very different situations. On that
 * box the user had picked `Force CPU` himself in Settings, Hardware, ComfyUI
 * GPU, the app had listed his RTX 3060 correctly two panels away, and the
 * banner still told him no usable GPU had been found and then walked him
 * through three sentences of AMD advice on a machine with no AMD card in it.
 *
 * The state is distinguishable, so it gets distinguished. `get_comfy_gpu_status`
 * already returns all three facts (`mode`, `startedCpu`, `hasAmd`); only the
 * frontend was throwing two of them away.
 *
 *   1. `mode === 'cpu'`  the user chose this. Say so, and say where to undo it.
 *   2. no AMD card       the old sentence, which is true here: nothing usable
 *                        was found.
 *   3. an AMD card       the same sentence plus the AMD route, which is the
 *                        one case where those three sentences help.
 *
 * Pure and stringly on purpose: the Create tab is a .tsx the node-environment
 * test runner does not render, so the copy lives where it can be asserted.
