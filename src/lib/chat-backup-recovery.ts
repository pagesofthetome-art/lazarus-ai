/**
 * One look into the native backup for chats the chat store never saved.
 *
 * Chromium refuses an IndexedDB value above 127 MiB, measured in this build's
 * engine on 26.09.2026: "The serialized keys and/or value are too large
 * (size=209736576 bytes, max=133169152 bytes)". WebView2 is Chromium. With
 * every image inline, a handful of chats with phone photos crossed that line,
 * and from then on every save of the chat store failed while the app kept
 * running on what it had in memory. The native backup took the same value
 * over IPC, so store_backup.json may hold chats that IndexedDB never got.
 *
 * Recovered, once, after the attachment store has made the history small:
 *   - a chat the store has, where the backup copy is newer (more messages)
 *   - a chat the store does not have, newer than the newest chat it does have
 * The second rule is what keeps a chat the user deleted from coming back: a
 * deleted chat is older than the ones the store kept writing after it.
