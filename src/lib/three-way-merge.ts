/**
 * Line-level three-way merge for staged changes.
 *
 * Morgan, 2026-08-11: every file in his finished run refused to apply with
 * "changed on disk after this edit was staged", so a six-step plan that the
 * plan bar reported as done wrote nothing at all. The guard was right (the
 * file really had moved on, he runs other tools in the same folder), but a
 * guard whose only exit is Reject all throws away work the customer paid for.
 *
 * Almost always the two edits sit in different places in the file, and then
 * there is nothing to decide: take both. Only when the same lines moved on
 * both sides is there a real question, and only that case still refuses.
 *
 * Built on `diffLines` from ./diff, the same line diff the reviewed diff is
 * rendered from, so the merge can never disagree with what the user saw.

 * of a block the other side replaced does not conflict, so it was left out of
 * the group and opened its own one further down the loop. Its span then lay
 * BEHIND the write cursor: the cursor moved backwards, and the tail loop
 * re-emitted base lines the other side had deleted. The user's deleted line
 * came back, ok:true, with no conflict and no undo.

 * Grouping is therefore inclusive at the edges: anything whose span touches the
 * group joins it, and the group decides afterwards whether the two sides
