 * behaviours used to hang on those NAMES and would silently die with them:
 * the read-only catalog for /review-style commands, the --no-verify ban, the
 * parsed summaries small models rely on, and the per-kind icon in the tool
 * block. They all hang on this file now.
 *
 * Read-only is deliberately conservative: a fixed prefix list, and any

 * outright instead of being parsed. A read-only mode that can be talked

 * tests a wider string and can only refuse MORE. SPLITTING one command into
 * two is what lets the flag land in a different segment than its commit, and
 * that is a bypass. So this errs towards merging wherever it is unsure, and
 * when the quotes do not balance it gives up (`null`) rather than guess —
 * the caller then falls back to testing the whole line, which is stricter
 * than any split could be.
 *
 * The separators are the ones {@link CHAINING} already names, so this agrees
 * with `isReadOnlyCommand` on what a separator IS — but only outside a quoted
 * string. That is the entire difference from the blind split this replaces:
 * `git commit -m "a;b" --no-verify` is ONE command, so the flag stays with
 * its commit and the ban no longer has to test the whole line to see it.
 *
 * A backslash escapes the next character outside quotes and inside double
 * quotes (inside single quotes POSIX says it is literal). That is not
 * decoration: a line continuation — `git commit -m x \` + newline +
 * `--no-verify` — is ONE command to the shell, and treating that newline as a
 * separator would put the flag in a segment of its own.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a shell tokenizer. It knows quotes and backslashes and
 * nothing else: no word splitting, no expansion, no operator precedence.

 * commit --no-verify` classified as 'git-status', `echo hi && …` and `cd

 * around, and then they route around it where it was right too. Counting
 * quotes removes the cause, so the test can be as narrow as the rule.
