/**
 * Coalescing PersistStorage for zustand's `persist` (2.6.3).
 *
 * WHY: zustand writes on EVERY set() with no debounce — `api.setState` is
 * wrapped as `savedSetState(...); return setItem()` (zustand/esm/middleware.mjs).
 * `createJSONStorage` then runs `JSON.stringify` over the WHOLE persisted state
 * inside that call. The chat store flushes once per animation frame while a
 * reply streams (useChat.ts), so a 30 s answer serialised the entire chat
 * history ~1800 times.
 *
 * With images in the history that history is multi-megabyte (ImageAttachment
 * carries base64 inline), and an IndexedDB put of that size takes far longer
 * than the 16 ms until the next frame. Every flush therefore minted another
 * multi-MB string AND another pending transaction, none of which could be
 * collected while the write was outstanding. Measured on a normal profile
 * (30 chats, 3 screenshots): 8.1 GB of string churn and 5.1 GB held live in
 * ~1100 queued writes across one answer. That is the renderer's Out of Memory.
 *
 * FIX: keep only the LATEST state reference and serialise it once per window,
 * not once per set(). Because the store updates immutably, holding the
 * reference is free and serialising late yields the newest snapshot — exactly
 * the value the last write would have produced. At most one write is ever in
 * flight; anything that arrives during it collapses into a single follow-up.
 *
 * Durability: a trailing write lands `waitMs` after the last change, and
 * `maxWaitMs` caps how long a continuously-changing store can go unwritten, so
 * a long stream still checkpoints. `flush()` forces the pending write out; the
 * call site fires it when a turn finishes and on pagehide/visibilitychange.
 *
 * The flush is best effort on the way out, and cannot be anything else: an
 * IndexedDB write is asynchronous and the window does not wait for it during
 * unload. That is why `waitMs` is short and why the call site flushes when a
 * turn ENDS rather than relying on the unload path.
 *
 * What that flush is worth, precisely — the old wording here said a finished
 * answer is "already on disk by the time anyone can close the app", and that
 * was not measured. It is now (stores/durability.ts carries the numbers, taken
 * in a real Chromium against real IndexedDB):
 *
 *   - `flush()` resolves when the put has LANDED, so awaiting it is a real
 *     guarantee, and the three chat hooks now await it before they report a
 *     turn finished. Once the app says the turn is over, the turn is readable
 *     out of the store. On an idle Mac that costs under 2 ms; with the CPU
 *     throttled 20x on a 6.5 MB profile it cost 323-545 ms, and that is the
 *     Stop button waiting, not the text — the answer is painted long before.
 *   - It is NOT true that the answer is on disk as soon as it is on screen.
 *     The paint comes first and always will. A reload fired inside that window
 *     still loses the tail of the turn: six of six throttled runs, and four
 *     runs in twelve unthrottled on a busy machine — the same four in twelve
 *     with and without the awaited turn end, because the write starts at the
 *     same instant either way.
 *   - A stream killed mid-sentence still loses its last `waitMs` of tokens,
 *     which the pre-existing per-set() write could lose too (it was equally
 *     asynchronous, just with a narrower window).
