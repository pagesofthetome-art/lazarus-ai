/**
 * The loop's own answer to a false completion claim.
 *
 * Measured on R31 (gpt-oss-120b, Coding, retired hosted service, 2026-08-07): the model
 * wrote "All steps completed as requested" while the PlanBar, fed by the very
 * todo list the model maintains, read PLAN 13/30. The task text said "do not
 * stop early" in so many words. Nothing reconciled the two, so the run ended
 * and the claim stood.
 *
 * The plan length and the current step are already client-side state; whether
 * the run may end is therefore decidable without asking the model anything.
 * When the final turn arrives while the plan has open items, the loop gets a
 * bounded number of corrective steers naming the next open step. Bounded,
 * because a model that ignores two direct contradictions will ignore ten, and
 * an unbounded loop against a stubborn model is its own failure mode.
