/**
 * When the model's own chat template refuses the conversation (bug B3, 2.6.7).
 *
 * llama.cpp, the bundled engine, LM Studio and Ollama all render the GGUF's
 * Jinja chat template before the model sees anything. A strict template calls
 * raise_exception when the message sequence breaks its rules, the engine turns
 * that into HTTP 400, and the turn dies without a single token. The text that
 * comes back is written by the template author, not by us:
 *
 *   "System message must be at the beginning"                  (Mistral style)
 *   "Conversation roles must alternate user/assistant/..."      (Gemma 3)
 *   "Unable to generate parser for this template ... Jinja Exception: ..."
 *
 * Two things were wrong with how that reached the user. It was pasted in raw,
 * a Jinja stack trace with a line and column number into a chat bubble. And in
 * plain chat it arrived under the heading "Agent error", because the chat
 * tools route their turn through the agent executor, so a user who had never
 * touched Agent mode was told the agent had failed.
 *
 * The sequence itself is fixed in api/providers/normalize-system.ts. This is
 * what the user reads when a template refuses anyway.
