/**
 * A finished download is not a finished install.
 *
 * Voxyl AI, Discord #general 2026-08-13 17:00 UTC with a screenshot, confirmed
 * five minutes later by Aldrich Ironhart: on Extend Video and Animate Image the
 * Download and install button runs to the end and then sits on "Refreshing the
 * model list…" for good. Both have ComfyUI.
 *
 * Nothing was hanging. installModelBundle refreshed the list once, returned
 * happy, and Stage keeps the install card up until the model lists actually
 * refill. ComfyUI's directory scan was still running, so the lists came back
 * without the new file. That is not an error, which is why the retry loop in
 * useCreate (guarded on modelLoadError) never engaged either. Two dead ends
 * meeting at one frozen line of text. Image bundles fit through the old window
 * because they are a fraction of the size.
 *
 * This file covers the loop that was missing. The engine-facing half is
 * asserted at the source level below, the same way the codex gate test does it:
 * a React context around a live ComfyUI is not what should be mocked here.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/model-visible-wait.test.ts
