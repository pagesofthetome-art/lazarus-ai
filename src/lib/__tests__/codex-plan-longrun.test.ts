/**
 * A Plan-mode run is a LONG read: it explores before it writes anything down,
 * and with the context decay from wave one the same file legitimately comes
 * back several times, because its bytes aged out of the prompt in between.
 *
 * That is exactly the shape detector 3 of the loop guard was built to kill, so
 * plan mode would be unusable if the two were not composed correctly (S1). This
 * pins the composition: a realistic plan run with five identical reads of one
 * file across thirteen steps does NOT halt while those re-reads are the
 * sanctioned kind, and the negative control shows the guard is still awake.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/codex-plan-longrun.test.ts
