/**
 * The second half of GH #122, and the Discord thread "Read me first"
 * (ever.noob, 2026-08-28): LoRAs the user dropped into a folder of his own
 * stayed invisible.
 *
 * Lazarus never scans image or video models off the disk, that inventory comes out
 * of ComfyUI's own `/object_info` enums, and ComfyUI lists only what sits under
 * its own models tree. So there is nothing for Lazarus to scan here and no honest
 * way to call such a file Installed; the fix is to hand the folder to ComfyUI
 * through ComfyUI's own extra-model-paths mechanism. Which subfolders qualify,
 * and the fact that a flat folder qualifies for none, is proven in Rust
 * (`src-tauri/src/commands/custom_models.rs`). This file proves the handover
 * is wired and that the Settings copy no longer claims more than it does.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/custom-model-dir-comfy.test.ts
