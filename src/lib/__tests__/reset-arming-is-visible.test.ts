/**
 * Nebenbefund 2 of the R9 re-measure (2026-08-30): "Reset AI Backends to
 * defaults" looked like a dud on the first click. It is not. It is the same
 * arm-then-confirm mechanic the Cloud switch got in round 6, and the round 6
 * decision was that two clicks on ONE control is the cheapest confirmation
 * there is, cheaper than a dialog.
 *
 * So this round changes no behaviour. It checks the only thing that was ever
 * in question: whether the armed state SAYS so on screen. It does, in three
 * ways at once, and this test pins all three so a later refactor cannot quietly
 * turn the first click into a dud for real.
 *
 *   1. the label swaps to "Click again to reset <tab>"
 *   2. the colour goes from grey to red
 *   3. the weight goes to medium
 *
 * Plus the two releases that keep an armed button from lying in wait: the 4 s
 * timeout and the disarm on a tab switch.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/reset-arming-is-visible.test.ts

    // 1x1 canvas — Tailwind 4 renders red-400 as #ff6467, not the #f87171 the
