/**
 * The Linux packages may only claim paths that belong to us, and they have to
 * name every system library the bundled engine actually links against.
 *
 * GitHub #120 (AnnSdf1969, Ubuntu 26.04, 2026-08-28): dpkg refused the whole
 * install with "trying to overwrite '/usr/bin/llama-server', which is also in
 * package llama.cpp-tools". Tauri's deb and rpm bundlers copy every
 * `externalBin` straight into /usr/bin under its plain name, so the file name
 * IS the system path. Read out of the shipped 2.6.6 deb, which is the build
 * the reporter had:
 *
 *   ar x Lazarus_2.6.6_amd64.deb && tar tzf data.tar.gz | grep usr/bin
 *     usr/bin/llama-server        <- Debian's llama.cpp-tools owns this
 *     usr/bin/lazarus
 *
 * The rename to lazarus-llama-server closed that in 2.6.7. What was still only a
 * list of four forbidden llama names is now a positive rule, so the next
 * sidecar (an ffmpeg, a whisper server) cannot walk into the same trap.
 *
 * Second half, same package, found on the same artifact: the sidecar is not
 * static after all. The ELF in the shipped deb carries
 *
 *   DT_NEEDED libgomp.so.1
 *   DT_NEEDED libvulkan.so.1
 *
 * and neither libvulkan1 nor libgomp1 was in the package's Depends. On a box
 * without them the deb installs fine and the built-in engine then dies at
 * exec with "error while loading shared libraries", which reaches the user as
 * an engine that never answers on 127.0.0.1:8127. The dependency belongs in
 * the package, not in a support thread.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/linux-package-owns-its-paths.test.ts
