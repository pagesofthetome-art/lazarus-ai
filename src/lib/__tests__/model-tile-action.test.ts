/**
 * GH #118, the dead-button half: "the 'Get' button doesn't do anything as the
 * files are still downloaded". Once the badge told the truth again, the state
 * the reporter was left in was an inert "Installed" pill next to an engine that
 * was not running, and the Models page had no way on at all.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/model-tile-action.test.ts
