/**
 * CI has to try building the product, and it has to believe the exit code.
 *
 * THE GAP THIS NAILS SHUT
 * -----------------------
 * At 10bfa0d7 (v2.6.7 — the shipped product, not an experiment artefact)
 * `npm run tauri build` wrote its installers to disk and then exited 1:
 *
 *     Finished 2 bundles at: … .app … .dmg … .app.tar.gz (updater)
 *     Error A public key has been found, but no private key.
 *           Make sure to set `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable.
 *     TAURI_BUILD_EXIT=1
 *
 * `bundle.createUpdaterArtifacts` asked the bundler for signed updater
 * artefacts while `plugins.updater.pubkey` sat next to it, so the bundler
 * demanded a private key that only the release runner has. Anybody else —
 * contributor, fork, AGPL-3.0 §6 recipient — got exit 1. Fixed in a0030ad2 by
 * removing that one field. The release lane asks for the updater artefacts
 * itself (`--config src-tauri/tauri.release.conf.json`, see the last describe
 * below); `die-app-heisst-wie-die-app.test.ts` keeps the config half honest.
 *
 * This file keeps the OTHER half from coming back: the reason nobody noticed
 * for a whole release. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` ran `npm run build` (vite),
 * `cargo check` and `cargo test` — all three pass on a config that cannot be
 * bundled — and never ran `tauri build` once. The only lane that did was
 * release.yml, where TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY comes out of GitHub secrets, so
 * the single job able to see the failure was the one job configured never to
 * meet it. A build that produces artefacts and still exits non-zero was
 * structurally invisible to this project.
 *
 * WHAT IS ASSERTED, AND HOW
 * -------------------------
 * Two halves, deliberately:
 *
 *   1. Structure — the gate exists in ci.yml, covers exactly the platforms
 *      release.yml ships, reads no secret, and carries no escape hatch. Read
 *      out of the YAML text by job block, because this repo has no YAML parser
 *      as a declared dependency and adding one for a test is not worth a new
 *      supply-chain edge. The slicing relies on one documented property of a
 *      GitHub workflow file: jobs sit at exactly two spaces under `jobs:`.
 *
 *   2. Behaviour — `build_verdict` from scripts/ci-tauri-build.sh is EXECUTED
 *      in a real bash against real files on disk, including the precise
 *      "artefacts present, exit 1" shape above. Nothing here is mocked; the
 *      function that decides red-or-green is the function that runs in CI.
 *
 * VERIFICATION LIMIT, stated on purpose: no GitHub Actions run was permitted
 * for any of this. The workflow file has never executed. What is proven is the
 * script's judgement (locally, by execution), the file's syntax and schema
 * (actionlint 1.7.12 + shellcheck 0.11.0), and the structural claims below.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/release-build-gate.test.ts
