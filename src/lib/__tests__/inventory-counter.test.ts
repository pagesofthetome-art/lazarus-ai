/**
 * Befund 2 of the abnahme counter-check on the 2.6.7 Windows build
 * (2026-08-29, ergebnis-abnahme-durchklick.md).
 *
 * Opening the Models page showed the Installed tab reading "Installed 0" while
 * three cards on the same page read Installed, and the rail carried "Chat 2"
 * with no badge for Image and none for Video. Measured again after a restart:
 * at 1.2 seconds the two badges were still missing, at 5.2 seconds they were
 * right. Nothing stayed wrong. But for those seconds the page stated a number
 * it had not counted, and a stated zero is a claim: you own none of these.
 *
 * The rule: a counter shows a number only once there is a number. Until then
 * it shows that it is counting.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/inventory-counter.test.ts
