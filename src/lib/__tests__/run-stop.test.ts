/**
 * Audit M1, Stop must end a /loop that a DIFFERENT hook instance started.
 *
 * The bug, exactly: the Code view and the chat view unmount on a tab switch. The
 * /loop driver lives in the `finally` of the pass, inside the closure of the
 * instance that started it. Stop set `userStoppedRef.current = true` on the
 * REMOUNTED instance, a different ref object, so the old closure read `false`,
 * scheduled the next pass, and the loop came back. The loop has no pass ceiling
 * by design ("there is NO built-in ceiling … the stop button is the brake"), so
 * that left an unattended agent with full shell and write access running with no
 * way for the user to turn it off.
 *
 * The Agent surface had the mirror-image bug: stopAgent set the flag and NOTHING
 * ever cleared it, so after one Stop anywhere in the session every later /loop
 * ran a single pass and quit, silently.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/run-stop.test.ts
