/**
 * Read-only turns must be enforced where the tools RUN, not only where they are

 *
 * Live on the ship exe, 2026-07-25: /plan is read-only, every one of its six
 * requests carried a catalog of file_read / file_list / file_search only, and
 * it still created helper.js on disk. The loose-parse fallback lifts a call the
 * model wrote as prose and hands the name to toolRegistry.execute, which
 * resolves by name and never asks whether this turn was allowed to offer it.
 * Code Review Mode carried the same hole and made the same promise.
 *
 * These tests pin the guard itself (the filter both hooks apply to a batch) and
 * assert the source still contains it, so the belt cannot quietly come off
 * again.
