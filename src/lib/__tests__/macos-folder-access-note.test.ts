/**
 * A14 (2.6.8), David: a folder under ~/Desktop, ~/Documents or ~/Downloads
 * makes macOS ask for access the first time Lazarus walks it. That dialog is the
 * system asking on the user's behalf and nothing may prevent it; what the
 * panel can do is stop it from arriving as a surprise from an app that just
 * started reading a folder.
 *
 * The rule is deliberately narrow. A note that fires everywhere is a note
 * nobody reads, and a note on Windows would be a claim about an operating
 * system that never asks.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/macos-folder-access-note.test.ts
