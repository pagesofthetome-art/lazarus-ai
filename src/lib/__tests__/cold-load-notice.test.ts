/**
 * R14 Nebenbefund 3 (2026-08-30, ergebnis-r14-nachmessung.md): straight after a
 * ComfyUI restart, a healthy GPU render sat in `Loading model...` from 0 s to
 * 57 s, about 117 s to the finished picture, and the waiting area explained
 * none of it. R13 measured 0 s to 7 s for the same phase on a warm ComfyUI, so
 * the difference is the cold start and not the card.
 *
 * The load phase was already distinguishable from sampling: ComfyUI's WS
 * `executing` events drive createStore's `loading-model`, `loading-clip` and
 * `loading-vae` against `sampling`, and useCreate has mapped them for a long
 * time. No new channel, just a line in the waiting area once the load has run
 * long enough to be worth a word.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/cold-load-notice.test.ts
