/**
 * Loch 5, 6 und 7 des Denk-Audits (2.6.7, 2026-08-29): the three surfaces
 * beside chat, agent and coding.
 *
 *   5. Workflow engine, which carried its own hand-written copy of the balanced
 *      `<think>` regex. It missed the pre-opened Qwen3 shape (closer without
 *      opener), a turn cut off mid-thought, and every non-canonical marker.
 *      A workflow step's output is not only shown, it becomes a workflow
 *      VARIABLE and rides into every later step's prompt, so leaked reasoning
 *      compounds down the chain.
 *   6. A/B compare, which sent no thinking signal at all and stripped nothing, so
 *      the comparison ran on whatever the backend happened to default to and
 *      the raw reasoning was part of what the user was comparing.
 *   7. Benchmark, which counted a reasoning chunk only on the NATIVE channel. A
 *      backend without one sends the thought inline as `<think>` inside the
 *      content (Ollama with the flag unset, llama.cpp with reasoning-format
 *      none, LM Studio), so it landed in the answer text the correctness
 *      check scores, and thinkShare read 0 on exactly the local backends the
 *      board exists to compare.
 *
