/**
 * R16 Befund 5, measured on the Windows box (2026-08-30): ComfyUI was killed
 * while the app kept running. Create then answered "ComfyUI is not running.
 * Wait for it to start." on every press, and nothing ever started it. Ten
 * minutes later port 8188 was still shut. Lazarus starts ComfyUI at app launch and
 * nowhere else, so the sentence promised an actor that did not exist.
 *
 * House rule: self healing before an error message.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/comfy-restart-guard.test.ts
