/**
 * Loch 4 des Denk-Audits (2.6.7, 2026-08-29): plain chat and group chat never
 * settled the turn.
 *
 * Both ran the char-by-char state machine and nothing else. That machine only
 * ever switches on a literal `<think>`. The Qwen3 chat templates put the
 * OPENER in the prompt, so the reply starts mid-thought and only ever sends
 * the closer, the machine never switches, and with the Think button ON
 * `finalStripThinkingTags` deliberately leaves canonical markers alone. Result
 * on the two surfaces a user reaches first: the whole reasoning plus a raw
 * `</think>` standing in the answer bubble, and an empty thinking block. A
 * thinking model that visibly does not think.
 *
 * The agent and coding loops had been carrying their own copy of the fix since
 * 2.6.6. Four hand-written copies, two of them incomplete, is the shape of bug
 * this audit was sent to end: there is one `settleThinking` now and every path
 * calls it.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/settle-thinking-plain-chat.test.ts
