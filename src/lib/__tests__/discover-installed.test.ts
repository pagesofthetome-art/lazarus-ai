/**
 * GH #118 (nayffy, 2026-08-27, fresh Windows 11 install, v2.6.6): "Uncensored
 * chat models download and state installed... If i close and reopen Lazarus, it
 * changed from 'Installed' to 'Get', but the 'Get' button doesn't do anything
 * as the files are still downloaded." In the same report the built-in engine
 * answered ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED on 127.0.0.1:8127.
 *
 * The rule these tests hold down: the badge is a question about the DISK. An
 * engine that is not answering is a reason to start it, never a reason to tell
 * a user that their multi-gigabyte file is gone.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/discover-installed.test.ts
