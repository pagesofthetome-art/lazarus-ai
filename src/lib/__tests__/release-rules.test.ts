/**
 * The release everyone is waiting for must not announce itself as obsolete.
 *
 * Found by the review of the D1 prerelease fix (2026-08-14). `/releases/latest`
 * returns the release flagged Latest, and we publish as a prerelease and flip
 * that flag only after verifying the build. So on the day 2.6.5 goes out it is
 * NOT latest, the old rule read that as "old", and the brand-new release got
 * "This is an old release" stamped on it within a minute of appearing. The
 * Discord announcement quotes the release body, so the banner would have gone
 * out with the announcement.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/release-banner-rules.test.ts
