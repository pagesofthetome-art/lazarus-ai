/**
 * What happens to the backend that was in the `openai` slot when Add Provider
 * puts another one there.
 *
 * Nebenbefund 3 of the R10 re-measure on the 2.6.7 Windows build
 * (2026-08-30), and the only path found on which a provider card really does
 * disappear without a trace:
 *
 *   Settings, AI Backends, Add Provider, entry "Jan"
 *   (http://localhost:1337/v1). Afterwards the providers list holds Jan
 *   (LOCAL) and retired hosted service. The Built-in Engine card is gone, together with the
 *   BUILT-IN ENGINE (EXPERT) section. Nothing on the Jan card says where the
 *   built-in engine went.
 *
 * And then the sharp edge: switching Jan off leaves the Jan card standing with
 * its Enable button, but now there is no local backend at all. The picker says
 * "No models available" and lists none of the three installed local models,
 * although the user never switched the built-in engine off.
 *
 * The way back exists and is unlabelled: Add Provider, entry "Built-in
 * Engine". That is what the user who wrote "the card was completely gone, no
 * way back" almost certainly missed. R9's Disable button, which the report was
 * first read against, is clean.
 *
 * Why the card vanishes at all: `ProviderId` is a fixed set of four slots and
 * every OpenAI-protocol backend lives in the single `openai` one. The list
 * holds one local OpenAI-compatible backend at a time, which is a design
 * decision, not a bug. Losing the previous one without a word is the bug.
 *
 * The answer reuses the mechanic R10 built for Disable: the backend that was
 * pushed out keeps a card, greyed, with an Enable button that hands the slot
 * back. It is remembered as `displaced` ON the slot config, so it survives a
 * restart the same way the slot itself does, and the handback swaps rather
 * than forgets, so the backend the user just added does not vanish silently in
 * its turn either.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT touched, these are the counter-poles from R10 and their
 * tests must stay green:
 *  - a fresh install: nothing was ever pushed out, so there is no extra card,
 *  - onboarding handing the slot to Ollama: it parks the slot disabled without
 *    anyone pressing anything, and a slot that was already off is not being
 *    taken away from the user. Only an ENABLED occupant is remembered.

/**

 * Add Provider could not be taken off the list again. The card offers Endpoint,
 * Test and Disable, and nothing else, in every state, so the only way back to
 * the shipped list was `Reset AI Backends to defaults`, which also throws away
 * every other backend the user had set up.
 *
 * Remove is not a new mechanic, it is the handover read the other way round.
 * The four slot ids (`ollama`, `openai`, `anthropic`, `lu-cloud`) are the fixed
 * shape of the store and none of them can be deleted; what a user really added
 * is a BACKEND placed into the shared `openai` slot on top of something else,
 * and removing it means putting the slot back the way it was before the
 * takeover. That is exactly what `displaced` remembers, so Remove is offered
 * where, and only where, there is a remembered state to return to:
 *
 *  - on the occupant, when it is not the app's own engine. The built-in engine
 *    is the floor everybody else stands on; removing it would leave the slot
 *    with nothing to fall back to and re-open the hole R10 closed.
 *  - on the standby card, for the same reason in the other direction: after a
 *    handback the added backend is the one waiting there, and forgetting it is
 *    the same wish as removing it. The built-in engine on standby is never
 *    forgotten, because that card IS the way back.
