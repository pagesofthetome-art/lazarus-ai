/**
 * One answer to "can this model use tools, and how" (2.5.9).
 *
 * Three signals existed and every surface combined them differently, so the
 * dropdown, the Agent toggle and the Code run could disagree about the same
 * model:
 *
 *   1. the reactive cache (api/tool-capability) — a run PROVED the model
 *      rejects a `tools` payload (some compatible endpoints return 405,
 *      Ollama says "does not support tools")
 *   2. the server's own answer — a provider may return `supports_tools`.
 *   3. the family-name heuristic in model-compatibility
 *
 * AgentModeToggle already layered 1 > 2 > 3 correctly. The chat dropdown used
 * a different pair for its icon, and useCodex used none of them: it hardcoded
 * `native` for every non-Ollama provider, so picking a declared-no-tools remote
 * model in Code sent the request anyway, ate a 405, cached the negative, and
 * repeated the whole thing 24 h later when the negative expired.
 *
 * This module is that precedence, once, so all of them move together.
