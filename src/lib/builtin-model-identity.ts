 * Counter-check finding, Windows box 2026-08-28: with Gemma loaded, a request
 * carrying `"model": "Hermes-3-Llama-3.2-3B.Q4_K_M"` and even one carrying
 * `"model": "gibt-es-nicht-42"` were both answered by Gemma, with no error and
 * no model change. That is llama-server behaving as documented: it serves the
 * one model it was started with and treats the `model` field as a label. The
 * app never checked, so the user could be shown one name and be answered by
 * another. In a group chat with two local speakers that is not an edge case,
 * it is every single round.
 *
 * These are the pure halves of the check: the picker id of a loaded GGUF path,
 * the bare id behind a picker id, and the comparison between them. Kept apart
 * from `api/builtin-ensure` so the rules can be tested without a store or a
 * Tauri backend, and so the Rust guard in `commands/proxy.rs` has a readable
 * twin to mirror (`builtin_model_name_from_path` there).
