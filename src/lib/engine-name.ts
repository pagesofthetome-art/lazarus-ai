 * stays: the provider slot is still `openai`, the preset id is still
 * `builtin`, the Tauri commands are still `*_bundled_engine`.
 *
 * Two names therefore exist in the wild at once. The old one is written into
 * `lu-providers` on every machine that ran an earlier version, into the
 * `displaced` memory of the openai slot, and into chats that recorded which
 * backend answered. So the app WRITES the new name and READS both.
