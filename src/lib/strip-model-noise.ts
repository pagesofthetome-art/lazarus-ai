/**
 * Display safety net: the user must only ever see real prose answers plus the
 * rendered tool-call BLOCKS, never raw orchestration.
 *
 * This lived inside CodexView until 2.5.9, which meant it protected the Code
 * tab ONLY. Agent mode and plain chat render through MessageBubble and were
 * getting the raw string — so the exact leak David reported twice
 * (`ool_call>` from Qwen3-32B through retired hosted service) was still on screen after the
 * "fix", because the fix was in the other view. Shared module now: one strip,
 * every surface.
 *
 * Two tiers on purpose:
 *   - The default set removes text that is NEVER a legitimate answer.
 *   - `aggressive` additionally removes tool-call JSON dumps. That is right
 *     while a tool loop is driving (Code, Agent), but wrong in plain chat,
 *     where `{"name": …, "arguments": …}` can be exactly what the user asked
 *     the model to print.
