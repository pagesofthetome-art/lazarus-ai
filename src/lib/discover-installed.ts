/**
 * Is a Discover row already on this machine, and if so, which local model is it.
 *
 * Pulled out of DiscoverModels.tsx (GH #118) because the answer is the whole
 * bug. nayffy's fresh Windows 11 install downloaded a chat model, the tile said
 * Installed, a restart flipped it back to "Get", and the button then did
 * nothing while the multi-gigabyte file sat on the disk the entire time.
 *
 * THE RULE, and the reason this file exists: installed is a question about the
 * DISK, never about a port. Every input below is filesystem evidence:
 *
 *  - `downloads`: this session's finished downloads, which are files that were
 *    written. Fastest path, gone after a restart, never the only source.
 *  - `installedModels`: what the model refresh read off the disk. For the
 *    built-in engine that list comes from `list_bundled_models`, a Rust
 *    directory scan that does not talk to the engine at all, and for Ollama and
 *    LM Studio from their own on-disk stores.
 *
 * Nothing here may ever consult engine health, a `/v1/models` request or a
 * provider connection state. An engine that is down is a reason to start it,
 * never a reason to tell the user their 8 GB file is not there.
