/**
 * IndexedDB-backed Zustand persist storage (v2.5.0).
 *
 * WHY: chat history + memories were persisted to localStorage, whose hard
 * ~5 MB per-origin cap is far too small for real chat history (long threads,
 * inline images, imported transcripts). localStorage is also the wrong tool —
 * it's a tiny synchronous key/value store. The standard fix web apps use is
 * IndexedDB, which is disk-backed and scales to tens of GB (Chromium grants an
 * origin up to ~60% of free disk, more with persistent-storage). Lazarus already
 * uses IndexedDB for RAG chunks + memory embeddings; this brings the chat +
 * memory STORES onto the same durable, large backend.
 *
 * DESIGN:
 *   - idb-first, with a ONE-TIME migration read from the legacy localStorage
 *     key (so existing users keep their chats/memories on upgrade), after which
 *     the localStorage copy is dropped to free that 5 MB.
 *   - SYNC localStorage fallback when IndexedDB is unavailable (the vitest
 *     `node` env, or a degraded webview). Returning a plain value (not a
 *     Promise) there keeps Zustand hydration synchronous in tests — exactly the
 *     old behaviour — so the suite is unaffected. In the real WebView2 app
 *     `indexedDB` exists, so getItem/setItem return Promises and persist
 *     hydrates asynchronously (a sub-100 ms tick on launch).
 *   - `navigator.storage.persist()` is requested once so the browser treats the
 *     data as durable and never evicts it under pressure.
 *
 * Still wrapped in `createJSONStorage(() => idbStorage)` at the call site — the
 * FIX-3 lesson: Zustand v5 `storage` needs a PersistStorage, and createJSONStorage
 * does the object<->string (de)serialisation around this string StateStorage.
