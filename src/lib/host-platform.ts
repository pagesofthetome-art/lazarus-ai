// Which machine the agent is standing on, and the one line of prompt that says

// This replaces the desktop_open and app_launch tools (removed 2026-08-06).
// Those were wrappers around `open` / `explorer` / `xdg-open`, which is the
// anti-pattern Anthropic names outright in "Writing effective tools for AI
// agents": tools that merely wrap existing software functionality. No competitor
// ships one either; Claude Code, Cline and the rest use a single shell tool.
// They also cost ~478 tokens of every system prompt on a registry where the
// full tool set already does not fit a 4k-context local model, so they hurt
// exactly the models they were meant to help. And they bought no safety:
// shell_execute sits behind the same confirmation gate.
//
// The one real thing they gave a weak model was not having to guess between
// `open` and `explorer`. That is a prompt problem, and this is the fix: ~60
// tokens that also spare the agent a system_info round trip and improve every
// other shell task, not just opening a folder.
