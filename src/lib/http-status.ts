// transport, and both are on the hot path of every run.

// out-of-credits refusal was retried twice with backoff before anything was
// shown, and a dying run looked like work for another 4.5 seconds.

/**
 * Is retrying this failure pointless? True for a deterministic client error:
 * the same request will be refused the same way, so the run must stop and say
 * so instead of burning seconds on backoff.
 *
 * "Deterministic" is about the request, not about the status number, and three
 * 4xx codes are not:
 *
 * 429 is the one that makes this worth a function. retired hosted service answers it for
 * three different things: the per-user burst guard, an upstream provider
 * throttle (both genuinely transient, both send retry-after), and an empty
 * wallet, which no amount of waiting fixes. Only the last one is terminal, and
 * it is the only one that carries `code: 'credits_exhausted'`.
 *
 * 408 is a request timeout, which is the definition of worth another try.
 *
 * 401 depends on WHOSE credential it is. For a provider the user configured
 * with an API key, a refusal is final until they fix the key. retired hosted service does
 * not work that way: its bearer is a Supabase access token that lives about an
 * hour and is re-minted per call by LuCloudProvider.delegate(), so a 401 in
 * the middle of a long agent run usually means nothing worse than "that token
 * just aged out". The retry calls delegate() again, getSession() hands back a
 * fresh token, and the user never learns it happened. Treating it as terminal
 * ended the run at the first refusal with "unauthenticated", or worse with
 * "Invalid API key, check Settings > Providers" for a provider that has no API
 * key field. api/cloud/jobs.ts states the same policy for the same cloud, with
 * the same reason: a failed lazy refresh must not tell a signed-in user to
 * sign in. When the session really is gone, getAccessToken() returns nothing
 * and the provider throws `signed_out`, which IS terminal, so the dead end
 * costs one backoff and then says the true thing.

 * waited 1.5 s and then 3 s. Both retries therefore landed inside the very
 * same window that had just refused them, and a throttled run died after 4.5 s
