/**
 * The send budget for the CONVERSATION surfaces (2.6.6, plan A4).
 *
 * A2 put a ceiling on what one agent step may send. The three chat surfaces had
 * none, and two of them multiply every byte:
 *
 *  - plain chat rebuilds the full history on every send, so turn 60 of a long
 *    chat pays for turns 1 to 59 again to ask "and shorter please";
 *  - a group round sends that same full history to two to four models, so one
 *    round costs history level times N;
 *  - compare sends it to both sides of the panel, every round, uncapped.
 *
 * So all three get the A2 number: min(0.8 x model window,
 * codexSendWindowTokens) on a paid provider. Since 2.6.8 a local backend gets
 * the same shape without the cost ceiling — 0.8 x its own window — because an
 * overflowing window is not a billing problem; see chatBudgetApplies below,
 * "WARUM DAS TOR AUFGEHT". The contextDecay notaus still returns every
 * surface to exactly the payload it sent before, which is what makes this
 * supportable in the field without a rollback release.
 *
 * The message-COUNT cap (capMessageCount) stays where it is on every path. It
 * guards a different failure: a chat of many short turns fits every token
 * budget while the count climbs past the proxy's 400-message gate.

/**
 * Whether a payload to this provider is capped at all, answerable before the

 *
 * Since 2.6.8 (Compact-Schritt 2) the answer is yes for every provider, so
 * the only thing that switches it off is the contextDecay notaus. The window
 * lookup behind it now goes through the Ollama context cache, so asking is
 * one round trip per model for the life of the app instead of one per send.
 *
 * ── WARUM DAS TOR AUFGEHT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The gate used to ask `isPaidProvider`, which answers a COST question: is a
 * token sent a token billed? That is the right question for the size of the
 * cap, and it is still what decides it — a paid step is held to
 * codexSendWindowTokens, a local one is not. It was the wrong question for
 * whether to cap AT ALL, because a history that outgrows the window is not a
 * billing problem, it is a correctness problem, and a local model has it too:
 * it truncates, silently, from the front — which is where the task is.
 *
 * That local chat had no cap was measurable as an inconsistency inside the app
 * rather than a judgement call. The SAME local model in Agent and in Coding
 * mode has been compacted all along (useAgentChat.ts, useCodex.ts, both via
 * trimWorkingHistory). Only plain chat and compare were uncapped, and nothing
 * about a chat turn makes a local model's window bigger than an agent turn
 * does.
 *
 * ── WAS SICH DAMIT AENDERT, UND WAS NICHT ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A local payload is now held to effectiveSendWindow's base, 0.8 x the model
 * window. Compaction runs with the A3 hysteresis on top, so it does not engage
 * at 0.8 but at 1.15 x 0.8 = 0.92 of the window, and then drops to 0.7 x 0.8 =
 * 0.56. So:
 *
 *   - below 92% of the window, a local chat is byte-identical to 2.6.7;
 *   - above it, the trim engages exactly where the model was about to drop the
 *     oldest turns itself, without saying so;
 *   - the 8% left over is not spare, it is the room the ANSWER needs. num_ctx
 *     covers prompt plus completion, and a prompt filled to the brim leaves a
 *     model no space to reply in.
 *
 * The contextDecay notaus still returns every surface, local included, to the
 * untouched 2.6.5 payload. That is what keeps this supportable in the field
 * without a rollback release, and it is the reason the notaus outranks the
 * provider question in the line above rather than sitting beside it.
