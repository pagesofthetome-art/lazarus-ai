/**
 * The tool list a system prompt shows the model, generated from the registry
 * instead of typed out by hand (2026-08-05).
 *
 * Every agent prompt carried its own hand-written "Available tools:" block, and
 * every one of them had fallen behind: the Agent prompt listed 15 of the 30
 * registered builtins. Missing were `file_edit` (so Agent mode rewrote whole
 * files where Code mode edits them), the entire git set, `run_tests`, the
 * background shell, and `todo_write`, a tool the model only ever uses if the
 * prompt tells it to.
 *
 * A name the prompt does not mention is a tool the model does not reach for,
 * whatever the request payload says, so this drift is silent capability loss.
 *
 * The roster is built from the tools the run will actually offer, after the
 * permission filter, so a blocked category is never advertised either.
