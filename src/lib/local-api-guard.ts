/**
 * GitHub #115 (graysoncooper): browser voice recording always failed because
 * the /local-api security middleware enforced application/json on EVERY POST
 * body, and /local-api/transcribe is the one endpoint whose body IS the raw
 * recorded audio (audio/webm from Chrome's MediaRecorder, audio/mp4 from
 * Safari). The 415 fired before the whisper handler ever saw the request.
 *
 * This module is the pure decision the middleware applies, importable both
 * by vite.config.ts (Node side) and by vitest. The transcribe carve-out
 * swaps the JSON requirement for an audio requirement rather than dropping
 * the check: a JSON or text body on /transcribe is still refused, and every
 * other endpoint keeps the strict application/json rule. CSRF protection
 * (the x-lazarus-request header and the origin check) stays on for
 * transcribe, the client sends the header like every backendCall does.
 *
 * `url` is mount-relative, the middleware mounts at '/local-api', so the
 * transcribe endpoint arrives here as '/transcribe'.
