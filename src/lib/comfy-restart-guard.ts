/**
 * Start ComfyUI again when a render finds it gone.
 *
 * R16 Befund 5, measured on the Windows box (2026-08-30): ComfyUI was killed
 * while the app kept running. Every press of Create then answered "ComfyUI is
 * not running. Wait for it to start." and nothing ever started it. Ten minutes
 * later port 8188 was still shut. The sentence was not just unhelpful, it was
 * untrue: nobody was going to start it. The app boots ComfyUI itself at launch
 * (process.rs::auto_start_comfyui), and that is the one and only moment it
 * ever did, so a ComfyUI that dies later stays dead for the rest of the
 * session.
 *
 * House rule, self healing before an error message: if Lazarus started it, Lazarus can
 * start it again. The rules this file follows:
 *
 *   - Only a ComfyUI Lazarus could have started is restarted. A remote host and a
 *     missing or half installed local one are somebody else's to fix, and
 *     saying so beats pretending to work on it.
 *   - A start that is already under way is waited out, never doubled. Two
 *     ComfyUI processes on one port is a worse state than none.
 *   - Attempts are bounded and spaced. A ComfyUI that crashes on boot must not
 *     turn one click into an endless restart loop.
 *   - Every state has its own words, and every one of them says what is
 *     happening or what the user has to do. No line promises an actor that
 *     does not exist.
