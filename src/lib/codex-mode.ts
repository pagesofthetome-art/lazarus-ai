/**
 * Coding-agent permission modes (plan 2.6.6, C1).
 *
 * Three user-visible presets sit OVER the knobs that already exist
 * (confirm gate, stage mode, review / read-only chain), so the three
 * overlapping systems get ONE operating logic instead of a fourth:
 *
 *   Ask     confirm every arbitrary-exec tool, stage file_write / file_edit
 *   Bypass  local asking off, staging off, the CLOUD shell gate stays
 *   Plan    the read-only chain armed for the whole conversation, plus a
 *           dedicated plan system prompt (see codex-plan-prompt.ts)
 *
 * BINDING (plan C1): a preset NEVER writes the global settings. The mode is
 * resolved per send inside useCodex and turned into effective knobs here.
 * useAgentChat and every other conversation keep reading the settings
 * unchanged, so a Bypass in conversation X cannot flip conversation Y or the
 * Agent surface (codexShellGate is consumed by BOTH loops since G15a).
 *
 * Internally a mode is a ruleset {pattern -> ask | allow | deny}, the opencode
 * schema as the model (R3). The UI only ever shows the three presets; bash
 * globs like "git push*" are a later expansion of the same shape.
