/**
 * The reasoning-effort ladder: one place that decides which rung a request
 * actually asks for.
 *
 * Why a ladder per model instead of one fixed scale. Measured against the live
 * DeepInfra API on 2026-09-02 (ops/wissen/deepinfra-modellmatrix-2026-09-02.md):
 * most reasoners take low, medium and high, GLM 5.3 adds max, and
 * Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B answers 400 to BOTH high and max, naming low and medium as
 * the only rungs it has. A composer that sends one fixed scale to every model
 * breaks every single request on that last one.
 *
 * So the server declares the rungs per model (`reasoning_effort_levels` on
 * /api/inference/v1/models) and everything here clamps the user's wish onto
 * them. An older server sends no field, the ladder is empty, and an empty
 * ladder has to mean "exactly like before": 'high' while thinking is on, and
 * no effort control in the composer at all.
 *
 * 'none' is deliberately NOT a rung here. It is the off switch, the Think
 * button already says that, and on GLM 5.3 it is worse than useless: the model
 * keeps thinking and only stops separating the thought, so the monologue lands
 * in the customer's chat window and costs more tokens than sending nothing.
 */

/**
 * Ascending, cheapest first, and it holds the rungs and NOTHING else.
 *
 * 'none' and 'minimal' are both ways of saying off, not quiet rungs at the
 * bottom. They are filtered out of a declared ladder on the way in, so a server
 * that lists them cannot make the composer offer an off switch that contradicts
 * the Think button, and clamping can never answer with one either. That is the
 * difference between "think a little" and "do not think", and on GLM 5.3 the
 * second one costs MORE than sending no parameter at all.
