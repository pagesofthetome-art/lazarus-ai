// The coding agent's "may I run this" gate, as app UI instead of window.confirm.
//
// It used to be a raw `window.confirm`, which in the Tauri webview renders as an
// OS dialog: system chrome, the app origin in the title bar, the whole prompt as
// one wall of text, and no way to say "stop asking". David, 2026-07-24, on
// seeing it fire for the first time: "der dialog ist ja hässlich wie sau".
//
// A promise-bridge is what lets the same awaitApproval contract keep working:
// useCodex still awaits a boolean, the store parks the resolver, the dialog
// resolves it on click.
