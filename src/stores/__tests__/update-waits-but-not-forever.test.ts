/**
 * Bug A1 (2.6.7), the two halves the 2.6.5 fix left standing.
 *
 * aldrich_ironhart on 2.6.5, Discord #general 18.08.: "has anyone lost their
 * chats after a restart??", then "My code chats are vaporised", a coding chat
 * around 230k tokens. sockenmonster on the same build lost nothing.
 *
 * The update path already flushes the coalesced stores before it hands the
 * process to the installer. Two things were still wrong with that.
 *
 * ONE. It awaited the flush with no deadline. flush() resolves when the
 * IndexedDB put has landed, and on a database that is blocked, broken or out
 * of room the put never lands and the promise never settles. That is not an
 * exotic case here, it is the population this whole fix is aimed at: the
 * machines whose IndexedDB is already in trouble. The button became a spinner
 * that never came back, and the way out of that is the user killing the app,
 * which is the exact hard kill the flush exists to avoid.
 *
 * TWO. Nothing wrote a fresh file backup before handing over. The backup triad
 * writes %APPDATA%/store_backup.json every 5 s and 1 s after a chat mutation,
 * so what survived an update was whatever the interval happened to catch. The
 * instant before a self update is the most valuable moment there is to have a
 * current copy outside the WebView2 profile, and it was the one moment nobody
 * asked for one.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/stores/__tests__/update-waits-but-not-forever.test.ts
