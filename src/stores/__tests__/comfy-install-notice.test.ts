/**
 * A15, Windows Nachlauf 02.09., Befund 5b: a ComfyUI requirements.txt with an
 * invented package on line 1 made `pip install -r` fail, the repair carried on
 * with the packages Lazarus knows about, and the run ended after 377 seconds on a green
 * panel. No error card, no hint, nothing in the log about the file that had
 * been passed over, so the user is left with a ComfyUI that is quietly short of
 * whatever that file asked for.
 *
 * Rust now sends one closing line with the finished run. The panel already had
 * a place for such a line (the cancel notice); this proves the line survives
 * the moment the run goes idle, and that a clean run still leaves none.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/stores/__tests__/comfy-install-notice.test.ts
