/**
 * Nebenbefund 2 of the R8 re-measure (2026-08-30, Windows box, installed
 * build): five seconds after a confirmed delete the file still stood in the
 * Installed list and the counter still showed the old number, while the file
 * itself was already off the disk. After about ten seconds both were right.
 *
 * No timer and no cache with a lifetime sat behind that. The list only ever
 * changed at the END of the reconcile chain that runs after the delete:
 * ComfyUI re-reads its model tree (POST /api/refresh, retried with 1s and 2s
 * pauses when it does not answer), then fetchModels does a reachability probe,
 * two /object_info reads and one stat over every remaining file. All of it
 * before a single pixel moved.
 *
 * The delete command has returned Ok by then, so the row and the counter are
 * allowed to say so straight away. The chain still runs and still has the last
 * word; this only stops the app from showing a corpse while it works.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/stores/__tests__/delete-inventory-lag.test.ts
