/**
 * The rung survives the update, and a nonsense rung cannot reach the wire.
 *
 * Two things have to hold for settings.reasoningEffort (2.6.8, store v22):
 *
 *  1. A profile written before the field existed lands on 'high'. That is not a
 *     taste: 'high' is the rung the client already put on the wire for thinking
 *     ON, so an existing customer's request is byte-for-byte what it was and
 *     their token bill does not move because they installed an update.
 *  2. A value outside the four rungs is normalised at the store edge. The field
 *     has a closed set of values; anything else would travel through the whole
 *     app as an unknown word, and the composer would draw a rung that the
 *     provider then does not send.
 *
 * Driven black-box like settingsStore-cloud-confirm-optin: seed a versioned
 * blob, fresh-import the store, assert what the user actually gets.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/stores/__tests__/settingsStore-effort-migration.test.ts
