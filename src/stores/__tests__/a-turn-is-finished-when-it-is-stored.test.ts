/**
 * A finished turn is readable out of the store by the time the app says the
 * turn is finished.
 *
 * ── What was wrong ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Three hooks ended a turn by announcing it and THEN starting the write:
 *
 *     setIsGenerating(false)      // Stop turns back into Send
 *     …
 *     void flushChatPersist()     // the write starts here
 *
 * Measured in a real Chromium against real IndexedDB (30 chats + 3 screenshots
 * = 6.48 MB persisted, CPU throttled 20x to stand in for a loaded machine), the
 * app reported the turn finished 323 ms, 327 ms and 522 ms before the turn
 * reached the store. A reload in that window came back without the answer in
 * six of six runs. Unthrottled on this Mac the same gap is 0.6-2 ms, which is
 * why it hid for so long.
 *
 * ── What this test pins ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The CONSEQUENCE, not the shape: at the instant the completion signal is
 * published, the persisted blob already contains the finished turn. Written
 * that way on purpose — `await` on line N is a detail, "the record exists when
 * the app claims it exists" is the promise.
 *
 * ── What is real here and what is not ──────────────────────────────────────
 * Real: the actual `useChatStore`, the actual `coalescedJSONStorage` window,
 * the actual `flushChatPersist`, the actual `endTurnDurably`. Nothing about the
 * path under test is stubbed.
 *
 * Not real: IndexedDB itself. The vitest environment is `node`, which has no
 * `indexedDB` and no jsdom, and the repo carries no fake — so the backend below
 * stands in for it as an ASYNCHRONOUS key/value store with a settable write
 * delay, which is the property the bug depends on. The engine-level behaviour
 * of IndexedDB (transaction commit, durability across a reload) is verified in
 * a real browser instead; e2e/chat-streaming-persist.spec.ts is that test.

/**
 * WHERE the call sits, not only THAT it is awaited.
 *
 * The awaited version of this contract has one silent way to lose: move
 * `endTurnDurably` further down its block. It still awaits, every existing
 * test still passes, and the write simply starts later. That is not a
 * hypothetical — it is the regress this fix already made once and measured:
 * with the call below the TTS and memory blocks the write began about 5 ms
 * after the paint and e2e/chat-streaming-persist.spec.ts went from never
 * losing a turn to three runs in ten. `flushes.map(f => f())` runs
 * SYNCHRONOUSLY, and that is where serialise-and-put happens, so every
 * statement above the call is time the write is not yet running.
 *
 * Two rules, because there are two ways to be late:
 *
 *   1. The write must start before the block starts anything ELSE. Enforced
 *      against a named list of jobs, not against "any call" — the cheap state
 *      resets a turn end does (clearing an aborter, nulling a ref, dropping a
 *      loading flag) may sit above the call in any order, and reordering them
 *      must stay green. Only work that TAKES time or SETS SOMETHING GOING
 *      counts.
 *   2. Nothing may be awaited before it. An `await` above the call hands the
 *      event loop the turn while the answer is still only in memory, which is
 *      strictly worse than any of the jobs in rule 1. This one needs no list.
 *
 * Rule 1 has an honest limit, stated here rather than discovered later: it
 * catches the call moving DOWN past work that already exists, not a NEW kind
 * of slow call being inserted above it. The list below is what makes it
 * concrete, so a third test keeps the list from rotting into a no-op.
 *
 * Known and deliberate: the /loop drivers in useCodex and useAgentChat call
 * `addMessage` AFTER the flush, so a loop-halt line rides the next coalescing
 * window instead of this turn's write. That predates this contract and is not
 * what these rules are about; it would need a second flush per turn, only in
 * the loop case.
