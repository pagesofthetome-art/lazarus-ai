/**
 * Model-Picker (v2.5.3, David 2026-06-10): before the VRAM swap of an
 * image/video generation, Lazarus itself (not the LLM) shows the installed
 * ComfyUI models inside the tool call so the user can pick one — with a
 * save icon to persist the choice for future prompts ("für nächste Prompts
 * übernommen"). This store is the rendezvous between the tool executor
 * (which awaits `request()`) and the ModelPickerCard UI (which resolves it
 * via `choose()` / `cancel()`). Same promise-gate pattern as the agent
 * approval queue in useAgentChat.
 *
 * Not persisted — a pending pick never survives a reload (the generation it
 * gates is gone too). The SAVED preference lives in settingsStore (v9 keys).
