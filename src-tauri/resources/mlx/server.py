"""MLX-Stable-Diffusion FastAPI sidecar.

Run by `commands::mlx::mlx_start` once the install slot has filled the
venv. Hosts a single POST /generate endpoint that the bridge proxies for
the web UI.

Model-agnostic: every request carries the full load config (repo, dtype,
fp16 variant, cfg kwarg name) resolved by the bridge from its image
catalog (commands/mlx.rs IMAGE_CATALOG). The sidecar keeps exactly one
pipeline in memory and swaps it out when a request names a different
repo — unified memory can't hold two big pipelines at once.
