//! Test-only OS helpers — one place where "and how does that work on Windows"
//! is answered for the whole crate.
//!
//! Nothing here ships: the module is `#[cfg(test)]` in `main.rs`.
//!
//! It exists because the process-level tests — `state.rs` (the quit path),
//! `commands/engine.rs` (the health wait) and `commands/bg_tasks.rs`
//! (cancel, quit sweep, working directory) — all need the same four things
//! from the OS: a shell that runs a POSIX one-liner, a child that stays alive
//! while the test works, an answer to "is this pid still a process", and the
//! children a process started. Each of them used to spell those out in Unix
//! terms only (`sh`, `sleep`, `ps -o state=`), which is why eight of them were
//! switched off on Windows — that is, on the platform whose process handling
//! differs the most from the one they were written on, and where being
//! untested is worth the least.
//!
//! Everything below is compiled on every platform (`if cfg!(windows)`, not
//! `#[cfg(windows)]`), so the Windows half at least type-checks in a macOS
//! `cargo test` run and the pure parts of the resolver are unit-tested at the
//! bottom of this file.
