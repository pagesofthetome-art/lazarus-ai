// ── K11/K14: foreign programs vs. our own bundled sidecars on Linux AppImage ─
//
// K2/K11 (Discord, mallic, 2026-09-16, CachyOS/Arch AppImage): after an
// in-app update, `git clone` inside the app failed with "no version
// information available" and custom-node installs broke the same way.
// Reinstalling did not help.
//
// linuxdeploy's AppRun exports `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` by PREPENDING
// `$APPDIR/usr/lib[/x86_64-linux-gnu]` onto whatever the shell already had,
// so it is inherited by every child process, including a system `git` found
// on PATH. On Arch/CachyOS, whose `libpcre2-8`/`libssl` are newer than the
// ones linuxdeploy bundled for the build host, the system `git` binary links
// against ITS OWN system libpcre2/libssl by SONAME, the dynamic loader finds
// Lazarus's older bundled copies FIRST because of the inherited path, and either
// a symbol-versioning mismatch ("no version information available") or an
// outright crash follows. Our own bundled sidecars (the llama.cpp server,
// `whisper_server.py`'s interpreter, ...) need exactly the libraries that
// variable points at, so this fix is scoped per spawned command instead of
// touching the process-wide environment: only the one child actually being
// started gets the cleaned value.
//
// K14 (Reddit, Linux, 2026-09-17) is the same bug one variable over: a
// ComfyUI venv's own `_ssl` extension failed to load under the same
// inherited `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and Lazarus's diagnosis misread the resulting
// ImportError as "this Python was built without ssl". The original fix
// above covered only `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` because that was the one variable
// K11's report named; K14 generalises it to the whole table linuxdeploy's
// AppRun is known to set (below), since nothing about the git bug was
// specific to that one variable.

/// K14 (Reddit, Linux, 2026-09-17): the same poisoning K11 fixed for
/// `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` also broke a ComfyUI venv's own `_ssl` extension after
/// an in-app AppImage update, `import ssl` failed inside a bundled
/// `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and Lazarus's own diagnosis then misread that as "this
/// Python was built without ssl" and sent the customer to reinstall Python,
/// which fixes nothing. `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` was never the only variable
/// linuxdeploy's AppRun exports for the bundle: PATH, PYTHONHOME, PYTHONPATH,
/// the GLib/GTK/GStreamer module-search variables, XDG_DATA_DIRS and the two
/// SSL_CERT_* variables (the last a common source of a Python that "loses"
/// its certificate bundle after being pointed at an AppImage-internal one)
/// are all in the same boat: a foreign program that inherits them looks
/// inside the AppImage mount for things that live at a different version, or
/// not at all, there.
///
/// Two shapes, because the two kinds of variable break differently:
///   * `PathList`: colon-separated, like `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Only the
///     AppImage-mount ENTRIES are removed, the rest of the list survives.
///   * `SingleValue`: one path. If it points inside the AppImage mount at
///     all, the whole variable is unset: there is no "the rest of it" to
///     keep, and a foreign program reading it half-stripped would be reading
///     a path segment, not a value.

// ── Reading the process table by COMMAND LINE ───────────────────────────────
//
// `System::refresh_processes` does NOT fetch command lines. Its refresh kind is
// memory + cpu + disk_usage + exe (sysinfo-0.33 `common/system.rs:296`), so
// `Process::cmd()` comes back as an EMPTY slice for every process, and any
// matcher that joins it silently compares against "".
//
// That is not a hypothetical. It cost this repo two independent bugs, and the
// second one is the reason this helper exists rather than a third copy of the
// same three lines:
//
//   * `process::find_orphaned_comfyui` (T-68) — the scan for a ComfyUI orphaned
//     by a hard kill found nothing at all, so Stop stayed the no-op the audit
//     described even after the adoption path was written.
//   * `remote::kill_orphaned_tunnels` (T-39) — the startup sweep that kills a
//     cloudflared tunnel surviving from the last run could never match, so a
//     tunnel kept publishing the LAN server to the internet while the app's own
//     indicator read OFF. AUDIT-COVERAGE.md recorded that finding as fixed,
//     because the fix LOOKED like it applied.
//
// One of the two got repaired and the other did not, purely because nobody knew
// they were the same line twice. So: one helper, one place to get this wrong.

/// * `video::video_cancel` (the mlx_video Python job) spawns through a plain

///   running on the GPU. This is the case the explicit walk was written for.
/// * `remote::kill_tunnel_child` (the cloudflared quick tunnel) spawns through
///   `spawn_piped`, so that child IS its own group leader and the old group
///   kill would have worked for it. The walk works for it too: it follows the
///   parent links, which exist either way, and it never signals a pid that is
///   not in the snapshot — so the wider process group is not a hazard.
///
/// What BOTH callers have to satisfy is the reaping contract: the tree MUST be
/// walked before the root dies (afterwards its children are reparented to init
/// and the parent links that identify them are gone), and the caller must not
/// have reaped the child itself — the `waitpid` at the end of the detached
/// thread is what keeps the pid reserved until the escalation has fired, and it
/// is also what keeps the process from becoming a permanent zombie. Both
/// callers hand over an unreaped `Child` and drop it afterwards without
/// waiting, which is exactly right.
