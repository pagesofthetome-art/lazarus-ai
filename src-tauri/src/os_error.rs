//! English text for errors the operating system worded itself.
//!
//! David, 2026-08-22, from the box: the app showed a proxy failure whose text
//! was half German. No German word exists anywhere in this repo. Windows wrote
//! it: `std::io::Error`'s Display calls FormatMessageW, which answers in the
//! system language, so a German Windows hands us "Es konnte keine Verbindung
//! hergestellt werden ... (os error 10061)" and we pass it straight through to
//! a user who set the app to English.
//!
//! The rule is that our messages are English. The cure cannot be a translation
//! table: we would be translating FROM an unknown language, and the set of
//! codes is open. So we do the opposite and never show the OS wording at all.
//! `ErrorKind` and the numeric code are language neutral, and between them they
//! carry everything the message was worth: what went wrong, and the number to
//! search for.
//!
//! The words of the operating system are ours to answer for even when a
//! foreign process (pip, git, ComfyUI, the import probe) carried them to us:
//! the user reads them inside our window, and P3 read two of them in German on
//! his English app. What such a process wrote ITSELF stays untouched, down to
//! the byte. Only the sentence Windows handed it is exchanged, and the code
//! that names it rides along.
