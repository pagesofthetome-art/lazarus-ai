//! Assembles the mobile client page out of `mobile-client/`.
//!
//! Until now the page a phone receives was a 2 964-line `r#"…"#` literal in
//! `commands/remote.rs`: HTML, CSS and 2 606 lines of JavaScript walled into a
//! Rust string. `tsc`, `eslint`, `prettier` and `vitest` cannot see inside a
//! Rust string, so none of them ever ran on it, and the tests that claimed to
//! cover it were hand-written TypeScript re-implementations sitting next to
//! it — two copies of the same rules, one of them maintained.
//!
//! Now `mobile-client/` holds real `.html`, `.css` and `.js` files, this
//! module glues them back into exactly the same bytes, and `build.rs` runs it
//! on every build.
//!
//! ── Why the glue lives in Rust and not in a Node script ──
//!
//! Because `cargo build` needs the result. A Node step would have to be
//! remembered by whoever runs cargo, and the thing it forgets to run produces
//! a file that is still lying there from last time. One assembler, run by the
//! build that consumes it, is the only arrangement where a stale page is not
//! reachable. The output goes to `OUT_DIR`, never into the repository, so
//! there is no checked-in copy that could go stale in the first place, and a
//! missing or broken source aborts the build instead of falling back to
//! whatever was there before.
//!
//! ── The two marker shapes ──
//!
//! `/*@@LAZARUS_TOOLING_ONLY@@*/ … /*@@LAZARUS_END@@*/` wraps the `import` / `export`
//! statements that make the four `.js` files a real module graph for tsc,
//! eslint and vitest. A classic `<script>` cannot carry those, so the
//! assembler cuts every such block out.
//!
//! `//@@LAZARUS_CAVEMAN@@` and friends are single marker lines that name where one
//! file is spliced into another. The spliced text lands at exactly the offset
//! the marker line occupied, which is what keeps the assembled page byte for
//! byte identical to the string it replaces.
