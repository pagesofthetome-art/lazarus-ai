/// True iff the Python pointed to by `python_bin` is PEP 668 protected
/// (Arch Linux, Debian 12+, Fedora 38+, Ubuntu 23.04+ ship Python with an
/// `EXTERNALLY-MANAGED` marker file in the stdlib dir, which makes
/// `python -m pip install ...` exit with
/// `error: externally-managed-environment` unless `--break-system-packages`
/// is passed). We probe by asking Python itself whether the marker exists
/// — robust against distro-specific path layouts and avoids parsing locale
/// dependent pip error strings.
///
/// Returns `false` on any probe error (Python missing, sysconfig broken,
/// stdout unparseable). That is the safe default: a false negative just
/// means we install without a venv exactly like Lazarus did before this bug,
/// which is fine on every distro that *isn't* PEP 668 protected.
