//! Wer gerade an ComfyUI arbeiten darf — und wie die Oberfläche davon erfährt.
//!
//! Drei Befehle greifen auf dasselbe ComfyUI-Verzeichnis zu: Installation,
//! Reparatur, Update. Sie teilen sich zwei Dinge, und beide liegen hier.
//!
//! Das erste ist der BESITZ. Bis 2.6.8 bewachte sich jeder der drei selbst,
//! indem er die Statuszeichenkette verglich — und zwar uneinheitlich, sodass
//! während des Clones (`"downloading"`) die Reparatur durchkam und das venv
//! unter einer laufenden Installation löschte. Eine Statuszeichenkette kann
//! "besetzt" nicht ausdrücken, weil sie zugleich der Fortschrittskanal der
//! Oberfläche ist. Also bekommt der Besitz ein eigenes Schloss.
//!
//! Das zweite ist der KANAL selbst: `install_comfyui_status` liest den
//! Statusschlitz, den alle drei beschreiben, und `cancel_comfyui_install`
//! setzt das Abbruchmerker-Flag, das alle drei in ihren Warteschleifen
//! abfragen. Beide gehören keinem der drei Aufträge allein — sie sind die
//! Bedienfläche über dem, was gerade läuft.
