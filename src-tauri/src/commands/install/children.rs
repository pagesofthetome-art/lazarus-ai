//! Das Register der Kindprozesse, die die Installer gerade laufen haben.
//!
//! Der geteilte Zustand ist eine prozessweite Menge von PIDs: jeder pip-Lauf
//! und der git-Clone tragen sich beim Start ein und beim Ende wieder aus. Wer
//! diese Menge liest, will sie töten — deshalb liegt hier neben dem Register
//! auch der einzige Weg hinein (`TrackedInstallerChild`, RAII) und der einzige
//! Weg, sie zu leeren (`kill_installer_children`, Teil des App-Endes).
//!
//! Die Naht läuft genau um diese Menge herum. Sie gehört weder zu pip noch
//! zu ComfyUI, obwohl beide sie füllen: eine veraltete PID darin ist ein
//! Kill auf die Zahl, die das Betriebssystem inzwischen weiterverwendet hat,
//! und diese Gefahr lässt sich nur an einer Stelle im Blick behalten.

/// the panel said "cancelled", which on the 100%-utilisation drives from Bug
/// #1 is precisely the machine that cannot afford it.
///
/// Quit killed nothing at all. ComfyUI, Ollama, the bundled engine, the MLX
/// sidecar and the trainer each have a slot that `shutdown_subprocesses`
/// walks; installer children had none, so closing the app mid-install left pip
/// and its descendants resident with no UI left that could stop them.
