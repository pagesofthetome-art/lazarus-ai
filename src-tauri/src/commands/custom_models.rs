//! The user's own model folder, handed to ComfyUI.
//!
//! GH #122 (zrmdsxa) plus the Discord thread "Read me first" (ever.noob):
//! the folder under Settings → Model Storage was a download target and nothing
//! more. Chat GGUFs in it are read by `engine::scan_gguf_roots` now, but a
//! `.safetensors` is a different problem: Lazarus never scans image or video models
//! off the disk at all. That inventory comes out of ComfyUI's own `/object_info`
//! enums, and ComfyUI only lists what sits under its own `models/` tree.
//!
//! So the honest way in is ComfyUI's own mechanism: an extra-model-paths config.
//! We write our own file and pass it with `--extra-model-paths-config`, so a
//! hand written `extra_model_paths.yaml` in the ComfyUI folder is never touched
//! and nothing changes for a user who set none. One limit is real and the
//! Settings text says it: only a ComfyUI that Lazarus starts is handed the folder.
//! The subfolders are scanned again on every one of those starts, so a folder
//! created after the setting was made arrives with the next start.
//!
//! Only subfolders NAMED like ComfyUI's model folders are mapped. A flat dump
//! of mixed files is left alone on purpose: mapping it into every key would
//! offer one checkpoint as a LoRA, a VAE and a ControlNet at the same time.
