///
///   "Error: Not an allowed workspace folder (only a folder you chose in Lazarus's
///    folder picker can be a workspace, pick it again to allow it): D:\code"
///
/// for a folder he had picked. Two halves of that chain had no measurement.
///
/// THE DURABLE HALF. Every other test here allows its root through
/// `allow_root_for_test`, which says in its own doc comment that it does not
/// persist. So the path the shipped app actually walks, `system::pick_folder`
/// to `remember_picked_root` to `workspace-roots.json` to the next start, was
/// never walked end to end, and "a pick survives a restart" was measured on
/// `save_roots_to`/`load_roots_from` alone, two functions the dialog never
/// calls directly.
///
/// THE MESSAGE. `check_workspace_root` asked the ALLOWLIST first and the
/// structural gate second, so a folder that no pick can ever allow ($HOME,
/// `C:\Users`, anything under `AppData`) came back with "pick it again to
/// allow it", an instruction that cannot work. Picking it again produced the
/// same sentence, because `system::pick_folder` threw the reason away
/// (`let _ = remember_picked_root(p)`). That is a closed loop, and it is the
/// reporter's sentence "even though that same folder was picked".
///
/// THE WINDOWS SHAPES. The reporter's path is `D:\code`, and the spellings that
/// reach these functions differ: the dialog can hand back an extended-length
/// `\\?\D:\code`, the frontend persists whatever it was given, and Windows folds
/// case. The rule that decides all of them is `win_is_within`, which is pure
