// P1 — Built-in inference engine (bundled llama.cpp `llama-server`).
//
// The whole point of 2.5.7's "onboarding without external providers" is that
// the app ships its own inference engine and never *requires* Ollama / LM
// Studio again. `llama-server` speaks an OpenAI-compatible API, so the
// existing `OpenAIProvider` + `proxy_localhost_stream_chunked` path drives it
// unchanged — this module owns only the *lifecycle* (spawn / health-wait /
// stop / model-swap) of the sidecar process, mirroring `start_ollama`.
//
// One model per process: `llama-server` loads a single GGUF, so a model swap
// is a stop→start with a new `-m` (Ollama-like, ~1-3 s). The child handle
// lives in `AppState.bundled_engine` and is killed in `shutdown_subprocesses`.

//     answers with token soup.

// fit check lives in the model picker (`computeFit`, src/components/models/
// ModelTiles.tsx), where it paints a coloured dot, and nothing of it ever
// reached the engine arguments.

// ── K1-14 (3.0.1): long install paths on Windows ───────────────────────────
//
// See klaerung-63.md and BERICHT.md #63: on Windows, `Command::current_dir`
// can itself fail on a long backend_dir before the child process ever
// starts. The decision below (which path to hand to `current_dir`, if any)
// is kept free of any real Windows API call so it can be unit tested on
// every host OS; only `windows_current_dir_for_backend` (cfg(windows)) wires
// it up to the real `GetShortPathNameW` call and real UTF-16 lengths.
//
// review-longpath.md Runde 1, Auflage 5: `Command::current_dir` does NOT
// call `SetCurrentDirectoryW` in this (the parent) process. Rust hands the
// path straight through as `CreateProcessW`'s `lpCurrentDirectory` argument
// (`library/std/src/sys/process/windows.rs`, `make_dirp`/the `si.lpCurrentDirectory`
// wiring); no `SetCurrentDirectoryW` call happens here at all. The classic
// length ceiling still applies to `lpCurrentDirectory` regardless: Microsoft's
// own `SetCurrentDirectory` reference page states it as a general rule about
// process creation, not about that one function's own parameter: "Important:
// Setting a current directory longer than MAX_PATH causes CreateProcessW to
// fail." Unlike `GetShortPathNameW`'s `lpszLongPath` (Auflage 1 below) or the
// handful of directory functions Microsoft explicitly re-lists under
// "Functions without MAX_PATH restrictions" (`SetCurrentDirectoryW` among
// them, opt-in via a `longPathAware` manifest plus the `LongPathsEnabled`
// registry value), Microsoft documents no `\\?\` or opt-in escape for
// `lpCurrentDirectory` itself. There is nothing to opt into here: the
// short-name fallback below is the only lever this code has.

/// Classic Win32 `MAX_PATH` is 260 wide chars including the terminating NUL.
/// review-longpath.md Runde 1, Auflage 2 (BLOCKER): `backend_dir` never ends
/// in a trailing backslash (it comes from `resource_dir()`, a plain
/// `PathBuf`), and Microsoft's own `SetCurrentDirectory` reference is
/// explicit about what that costs: "the final character before the null
/// character must be a backslash... specify >MAX_PATH-2 characters for the
/// path unless you include the trailing backslash". Without one, the last
/// SAFE length is therefore `MAX_PATH - 2` = 258, not 259: at 259, Windows'
/// own appended backslash plus the terminator pushes the real total to
/// exactly `MAX_PATH`, which the same page calls out by name ("Setting a
/// current directory longer than MAX_PATH causes CreateProcessW to fail").
/// 248 (`MAX_PATH - 12`) is a DIFFERENT limit, `CreateDirectory`'s own room
/// for an 8.3 name, and does not apply here (confirmed against Rust's own
/// `sys/path/windows.rs`, which only cites 248 for `CreateDirectory`).
///
