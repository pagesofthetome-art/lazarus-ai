    // ── the sweep against the REAL process table ────────────────────────────
    //
    // The pure tests above feed `is_stale_tunnel_process` hand-written strings
    // and have always passed — including for the fifteen months the sweep could
    // not match anything at all, because `refresh_processes` never fetched the
    // argv they were pretending to be. Something has to read real data.
    //
    // ── 01.09.2026: why the stand-in changed ──
    //
    // It used to be a COPY of `/bin/sh` named `cloudflared`, which is the only
    // way to get a live process whose `name()` is what the matcher wants. That
    // stand-in was reported failing twice under a full rebuild, and measuring
    // it explains why: **macOS SIGKILLs it.** An exec'd copy of a SIP platform
    // binary lived 95–486 ms across 15 measured spawns (mean ~250 ms) and was
    // then killed by the kernel, every single time — `sleep 30` was never
    // reached. The old test slept 50 ms and then took a process-table snapshot,
    // so it was racing the kernel inside a window of a few hundred
    // milliseconds. Idle it won; under load it did not, because the first
    // snapshot alone costs ~280 ms when 18 test threads contend for it
    // (measured). Once the window closed, the remaining 39 iterations scanned
    // for a corpse and the test reported "the sweep did not find a live
    // cloudflared" — blaming the sweep for the kernel's decision.
    //
    // So the stand-in is now a shebang script, which the OS keeps running
    // indefinitely: `/bin/sh` reading from a pipe this test holds. It blocks in
    // a builtin, so there is no `sleep` grandchild to orphan, and closing the
    // pipe or killing the child ends it at once.
    //
    // A shebang's `name()` is the interpreter ("bash" on macOS), not the
    // script, so THAT stand-in cannot impersonate a cloudflared — it carries a
    // real argv and a real name, which is what the three decomposed tests
    // below need, but not the name the sweep looks for. Linux differs: there
    // the kernel takes comm from the script's basename, so the script must
    // NOT be called `cloudflared` or the sweep finds it by name (measured on
    // Ubuntu 22.04, where `the_sweep_leaves_a_live_stranger_on_our_port_alone`
    // failed for exactly that reason).
    //
    // The positive end-to-end direction gets its own stand-in, and the reason
    // it is a different one is worth writing down: SIP kills copies of
    // PLATFORM binaries, not copies of anything. Measured the same way, 15
    // spawns of a copy of this crate's own (ad-hoc, linker-signed) test binary
    // ran past a second and exited normally every time, with no SIGKILL at
    // all. So `examples/park.rs` is compiled by the toolchain and copied under
    // the name `cloudflared` — a real process, really named that, really
    // publishing our port, found by the real sweep. See
    // `the_sweep_finds_a_real_cloudflared_by_its_argv`.
