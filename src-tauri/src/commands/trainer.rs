// 2.5.8 — local character trainer (Character Studio, local lane).
//
// Trains a character LoRA fully on the user's GPU with kohya's musubi-tuner,
// pinned to tag v0.3.4, inside its OWN venv (never the ComfyUI one — torch
// versions must be free to diverge). Z-Image is the trained architecture:
// Apache-licensed base, the only image family whose 12 GB training path is
// community-proven, and its finished LoRA drops straight into
// ComfyUI/models/loras after the documented Diffusers conversion — the
// existing local LoRA chain picks it up with no extra wiring.
//
// Command surface (mirrors the whisper/tts installer contracts):
//   install_character_trainer(installPath?)  one-time env setup, streamed
//   character_trainer_status()               env + base-model readiness probe
//   stage_training_image(setId, name, bytes) stage one photo of the set
//   start_character_training{..}             cache -> train -> convert -> loras/
//   character_training_status()              run status + logs + step counter
//   cancel_character_training()              cooperative cancel + child kill
//
// Security stance: no user-supplied URLs anywhere — repo + tag are hardcoded,
// base models resolve only from known filenames inside Lazarus-managed dirs, and
// the training-set id / names are sanitized before any path join.

/// It is NOT the whole fix. The launcher path (step 3 below) never asked

/// The third fix carried here is K3, 2026-09-18, corrected 2026-09-18 after

/// `accelerate/state.py`'s `PartialState.__init__` (v1.6.0, read from the
/// real cloned source, not guessed) never calls `init_process_group` without
/// `LOCAL_RANK`, card count or not. The actual trigger is one step earlier,
/// in musubi's own `prepare_accelerator()` (`training/accelerator_setup.py`):
/// it builds `InitProcessGroupKwargs(backend="gloo" if os.name == "nt" ...)`
/// whenever `torch.cuda.device_count() > 1`, and hands it to `Accelerator()`.
/// `Accelerator.__init__` (`accelerate/accelerator.py` Z. 460-461) turns that

/// `_prepare_backend` (`state.py` Z. 735-804) finds no `LOCAL_RANK` and
/// returns `("gloo", DistributedType.NO)` UNCHANGED: the backend name
/// itself leaks through even though nothing distributed was ever set up.
/// Back in `PartialState.__init__` (Z. 268-292), the branch that should read
/// `if self.backend is None:` is then false, because `self.backend == "gloo"`,
/// not `None`; the `else` arm calls `torch.distributed.get_world_size()` on a
/// process group that was never initialized. That call is, word for word,
/// the melders' traceback.
///
/// `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` pinned to one card (`pin_trainer_gpu`, resolved by
