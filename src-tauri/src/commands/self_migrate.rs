//! Moving an install the updater plugin cannot serve onto an AppImage it can.
//!
//! `install_method.rs` answers who owns the running file. Three of its answers
//! mean the plugin's install path would fail or would be wrong:
//!
//! * `pacman`: the AUR package `lazarus-bin` unpacks our `.deb`
//!   into `/usr`, the binary keeps the `DEB` marker the bundler patched in, and
//!   the plugin runs `pkexec dpkg -i` on a box with no dpkg. Even with dpkg it
//!   would write past the pacman database.
//! * `unknown` on Linux: the same deb, hand unpacked, with no package manager
//!   claiming the files.
//! * `appimage` in a folder the user cannot write to: the plugin's first step
//!   is a `rename` inside that folder and it fails with EACCES.
//!
//! On those three Lazarus installs itself into the home folder as an AppImage:
//! download, minisign check, atomic rename, a start menu entry of its own, and
//! a detached start of the new file. From then on `APPIMAGE` is set to a path
//! under `$XDG_DATA_HOME`, the folder is writable, and every later update is
//! the plugin's ordinary in place swap. Nothing is left for the user to do and
//! nothing is left for the user to read.
//!
//! Same rule as its neighbour: nothing from tauri in here. The whole sequence
//! has to be runnable inside an Arch container against the real AUR package,
//! which is what UPDATER-LINUX-BEFUND.md records. HTTP lives in
//! `self_migrate_cmd.rs`, everything else lives here.
