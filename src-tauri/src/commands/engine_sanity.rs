// ── Does the engine that just came up produce text at all? (bug a) ───────────

// `/health` answers 200 as soon as llama-server has loaded the weights and
// opened its port. It says nothing about whether the numbers coming out of the
// graphics card are numbers. Three reporters have now described the difference:
//
//   * GitHub 128 (Caldeiradas, 2026-09-09): endless question marks.
//   * Discord half_676767 (2026-09-09): the same runaway stream.
//   * Discord buzz0070615 (2026-08-17): character salad.
//
// The only one who named his hardware had a 2 GB card and a 3B model. On the
// 12 GB RTX 3060 here the same upstream Vulkan build answers coherent English
// on the card, on the processor, and with four layers offloaded, so nothing on
// this side of the house can reproduce it. What CAN be done without the card
// is to stop shipping the failure to the user: ask the engine one fixed
// question the moment it reports healthy, look at the answer, and if it is not
// text, take the graphics card out of the picture and start again.
//
// That is the house rule (self-healing before an error message) applied to a
// failure mode that today produces no error at all: a healthy port, a healthy
// process, and a chat full of question marks.
//
// This module is deliberately split in two halves. `judge` is pure and has no
// idea an engine exists, so the reporters' own samples can be run through it
// in a unit test. `probe_engine` is the one place that speaks HTTP, and it
// only ever speaks to 127.0.0.1: a cloud or LAN backend is somebody else's
// server, we did not start it, and restarting it is not ours to decide.
