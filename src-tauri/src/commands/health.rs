// glance" diagnostic. Each probe is bounded by a short HTTP timeout and
// classified into one of `ok` / `unreachable` / `timeout` / `not_installed`
// / `error` so the UI can colour-code without re-parsing strings.
//
// This is intentionally a one-shot synchronous probe (PROBE_TIMEOUT per
// backend, run concurrently), since Settings opens infrequently and a
// long-lived background poll would be more code for less value. The
// v2.4.5 "60s actionable ComfyUI panel" stays where it is; this is the

/// panel's `Timeout` wording). That is the same lie T5 removed for the
/// opposite case, pointing the other way: the panel told people a backend
/// they had never started was alive.
///
/// A third of the window is generous for what the connect phase does on THIS
