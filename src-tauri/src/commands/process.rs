///    Lazarus has made since Bug E, and for every install that has ever been

/// 3. From-source installs that predate the venv path depend on the system
///    Python having torch, so the system interpreters' prefixes are read.
///
/// All three are directory probes, never `python -c "import torch"`: the
/// scan runs over every candidate directory on the box and importing torch
/// costs seconds each.

/// Unix, so on Linux the answer was `false` for every from-source install and
/// for every install on any platform that had been repaired. The user was
/// told a working ComfyUI was broken, permanently — the onboarding step was
/// passable only via "Skip for now" and Settings offered only "Re-install"
/// (another 2 GB of PyTorch). See `python_prefix_has_torch` for the exact
/// mechanism that made the Unix branch dead code.
///
/// Returning `false` for a `main.py`-only carcass is still the point of
/// P14: a half-cloned ComfyUI dir from a previous abort (Python missing,
/// pip 403, network drop) used to be detected as "installed", which left

// object) and the graceful shutdown path covers the normal quit. Neither
// covers the case in the finding: Lazarus is SIGKILLed (or the box loses power on
// the app, or a dev session is hard-stopped), the ComfyUI child is reparented
// to init and keeps the GPU. On the next launch `state.comfy_process` is
// `None`, so the port probe reports "Already running", the status panel says
// running — and Stop returned `{"status":"not_running"}` and did nothing, for
// as long as that install lived. That is the read-only adoption the audit
// names: Lazarus could see the orphan and not touch it.
//
// The missing half is a way back to control. `find_orphaned_comfyui` looks for
// a ComfyUI process that Lazarus itself started, on Lazarus's own configured port, and
// `stop_comfyui` kills that tree instead of lying.

/// * it serves exactly `port`, not a port whose number merely starts the same
///   way (`--port 8188` must not match a ComfyUI on 81880).
///
/// Narrow on purpose: this decides whether Lazarus may kill a process it did not

//
// Both helpers below used to hardcode `http://localhost:8188` and
// `http://localhost:11434`, so on a user-configured ComfyUI port or a
// non-default Ollama base they asked a machine nobody was listening on. The
// address is not a second source of truth to invent: `AppState::comfy_host` /
// `comfy_port` (config.json, `set_comfyui_port`) and `AppState::ollama_base`
// (config.json `ollama_base`, then `OLLAMA_HOST`, then the default — see
// `state::load_ollama_base`) already are that source, and every other caller in
// the app reads them. These now do too.
//
// The second half of the finding is the return type. `bool` made "the backend
// let nothing go" and "Lazarus asked an address it does not own" the same answer,
// `false` — so a user on a custom port got the exact silence a user with an
// idle backend got. Fixing the address without fixing that would only move the
// silence one case further out: a ComfyUI on another machine still holds VRAM
// that freeing cannot help with, and that has to READ as "not Lazarus's to free",
// not as "nothing found".
