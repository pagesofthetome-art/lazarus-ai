//! Where a model lives, asked of the engine that has to find it.
//!
//! .__nothing_ (Discord help-chat, 2026-09-02, Windows 11, Lazarus 2.6.7): FramePack
//! F1 and Wan 2.1 installed through our own Get button and never appeared in
//! the Create picker. Moving the files into a different ComfyUI folder by hand
//! fixed it.
//!
//! Both halves of that sentence are the bug. Lazarus decided where the file goes on
//! its own: `<the folder we resolved>/models/<subfolder>`, built from a path we
//! found by looking for `main.py`. The picker asks something else entirely,
//! the RUNNING ComfyUI, through its `/object_info` enums. Two answers to one
//! question, and they only agree while the ComfyUI we found is the ComfyUI that
//! is running AND that ComfyUI keeps its models where we guessed.
//!
//! It does not, more often than we assumed:
//!   * The Comfy-Org desktop app keeps `main.py` in its program folder and the
//!     models under a base directory the user picked at install time, and it
//!     starts the server with `--base-directory`.
//!   * `--base-directory` does the same for anybody starting ComfyUI by hand.
//!   * An `extra_model_paths.yaml` adds roots that are nowhere near `main.py`.
//!     Lazarus writes one itself for the Model Storage folder (see custom_models.rs).
//!   * A second install on the box is the classic one (pnwpdr4519, 2026-07-27).
//!
//! In every one of those the download lands in a tree nothing scans, the picker
//! stays empty, and moving the file into the other ComfyUI folder fixes it.
//!
//! ComfyUI answers the question itself, exactly and per folder key:
//!
//!   GET /internal/folder_paths
//!   {"checkpoints": ["C:\\...\\models\\checkpoints"],
//!    "diffusion_models": ["C:\\...\\models\\unet", "C:\\...\\models\\diffusion_models"],
//!    ...}
//!
//! (`folder_names_and_paths[key][0]`, the directory list, in
//! api_server/routes/internal/internal_routes.py.) That is the single
//! definition of where a model lives, and it is the one the picker will use,
//! because it comes from the process that builds the picker's enums.
//!
//! Everything here is best effort. A ComfyUI that is not running answers
//! nothing, and a download must still work then: the caller falls back to the
//! old rule, which is right whenever there is nothing better to know.
