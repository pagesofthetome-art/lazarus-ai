//! The log file, as seen from the frontend.
//!
//! Audit finding #01: Lazarus wrote no log file at all. `init_tracing` had a single
//! stdout layer, and a shipped desktop app has no stdout — on Windows the
//! release binary is built with `windows_subsystem = "windows"`, on macOS it is
//! launched from Finder. Any bug that could not be reproduced on a developer
//! machine was therefore unreachable: the user had nothing to send.
//!
//! main.rs now owns the Rust half (a rolling file writer next to the crash
//! log). This module is the part the WebView can reach:
//!
//! * `log_write` — the frontend mirrors its own warn/error lines into the
//!   same file, so a support log holds BOTH halves of the app in one
//!   chronological stream. Without it the file would describe the backend of a
//!   bug whose visible half happened in React.
//! * `log_file_path` — Settings → Troubleshoot shows the user where the file
//!   is, which is the whole point of writing one.
//! * `log_reveal` — opens that folder in the file manager. `plugin:shell|open`
//!   cannot do this: with no `plugins.shell.open` entry in tauri.conf.json the
//!   plugin falls back to its built-in validator, which only accepts
//!   `https?:` / `mailto:` / `tel:` URLs and rejects a filesystem path.
