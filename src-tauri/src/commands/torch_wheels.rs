//! Which PyTorch wheels belong on THIS machine.
//!
//! Two environments in the app build a Python venv and put torch in it: the
//! ComfyUI environment (`install/`) and the character trainer (`trainer.rs`).
//! Both used to ask `nvidia-smi` and nothing else, so an AMD card was
//! indistinguishable from a machine with no card at all and got the wheels a
//! card-less box gets. On the ComfyUI side that is exactly what numbrain,
//! lapbo, petermanmancusso and sancora reported: ComfyUI installs, starts,
//! and renders on the processor, and forcing the GPU produces
//! "Torch not compiled with CUDA enabled" because the wheels really are
//! CUDA-only.
//!
//! The decisions live here as pure functions with the probes injected, so a
//! test can drive every branch on a machine that has none of the hardware.
//!
//! The LINUX ROCm side is MEASURED as of 2026-09-03, on a rented AMD Instinct
//! MI325X (gfx942, DigitalOcean tor1): the first channel below installs,
//! `torch.cuda.is_available()` answers True, and ComfyUI rendered an image, a
//! video, a song, a 4x upscale and a cutout on the card. Details in
//! ~/Desktop/Lazarus/amd-beweise/00-BEFUND.md. The WINDOWS side is still researched
//! against AMD's own index and Comfy-Desktop, because no Windows box with an
//! AMD card exists here.
