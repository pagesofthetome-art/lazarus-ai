; Free the bundled engine before the new files land. Live in EVERY build.
;
; aldrich_ironhart, 2026-08-10: the update stopped at "Error opening file for
; writing: D:\Locally Uncensored\llama-server.exe" with Abort, Retry, Ignore.
; The sidecar is our own (externalBin), and Windows locks a running
; image against writes, so the copy cannot succeed while it lives. Rust kills it
; on every orderly exit (state.rs shutdown_subprocesses), which is exactly why
; the installer never accounted for the cases that are left: the app still open
; during a manual install, or a sidecar orphaned by a crash. Retry then loops on
; the same lock and Ignore is worse than it looks, it leaves the new app running
; last release's engine.
;
; The test is the write itself, not a process list: if the file opens for
; writing, nothing holds it and we touch nothing.
;
; And when something does hold it, only OUR copy may die. `taskkill /F /T /IM`
; matches by image name for the whole session, so the first version of this
; hook also hard-killed a llama.cpp server the user had started themselves,
; mid-generation, during an update they never watched. llama.cpp is one of the
; backends this app detects, so having one running is normal, and everywhere
; else the app leaves a stranger alone: an engine start that meets one on its
; port refuses and asks the user to quit it (commands/engine.rs), and every
; kill in Rust goes by PID. The installer was the single place that swung at a
; name. It now ends exactly the processes whose image IS the file about to be
; overwritten. The path comes from WMI rather than Get-Process because the
; installer is 32 bit and .NET cannot read MainModule of a 64 bit process from
; there, which is what our own engine is.
;
; Last resort, when the lock outlives the four rounds because someone else
; holds it (a scanner, a backup agent, a process this user may not touch):
; Windows refuses to WRITE a locked image but still allows it to be RENAMED, so
; the old engine moves aside and the update lands. That is the whole point of
; the hook, and it beats the stock dialog where Retry loops on the same lock
; and Ignore leaves the new app running last release's engine. The leftover is
; swept at the start of the next install.
; The file name is a parameter since GitHub #120 renamed the sidecar to
; lu-llama-server.exe. An update coming from 2.6.6 or older still finds the old
; llama-server.exe in the install folder, possibly with a live process on it,
; so both names get freed and the one we no longer ship gets swept away.

; The old frontend bundle piles up forever, and nothing ever swept it.
;
; Measured on the Windows box on 2026-09-04, in an install folder that has
; taken every update since April:
;
;   _up_\dist\assets        1170 files      131,9 MB
;   of which from the build installed that morning   266
;   oldest file                                      2026-04-15
;
; So roughly 900 dead files and 110 MB that every updating user carries around.
; The cause is the pair of habits meeting: Vite puts a content hash in every
; chunk name, so a new build never overwrites the old chunk, it lands beside
; it, and NSIS only ever COPIES what the package brings, it never removes what
; the previous version left. Neither half is wrong on its own. Together they
; grow the install without limit.
;
; The whole folder belongs to the installer. There is nothing of the user's in
; it: chats, settings, models and outputs live under the app data folders, and
; the bundle identifier that names them never changes. So it can go wholesale
; and be laid down fresh.
;
; The check on index.html is not for us, it is for a wrong $INSTDIR. A
; recursive delete is the one instruction in this file that cannot be taken
; back, and it should only ever run where our own frontend really lies.
;
; A file that is still locked is skipped by RMDir without an error, which is
; the right outcome: one leftover chunk is harmless, and the next install
; sweeps it.
