/**
 * End-to-end cover for the 2.6.3 agent audit, driven through the real React
 * app against the built-in engine — the DEFAULT backend, and the one every
 * finding below was measured on.
 *
 * These are the checks no unit test can make, because each one is about the
 * loop, the view lifecycle and the transport agreeing with each other:
 *
 *   A1  the Code tab streams on a NON-Ollama transport (the built-in engine
 *       is providerId 'openai'); it used to sit silent until the whole call
 *       returned, which is what David reported repeatedly.
 *   A2  a run started before a tab switch is still stoppable afterwards — the
 *       view unmounts, the hook is rebuilt, and the store aborter is what
 *       carries the handle across.
 *   B1  edit → test → edit → test: the second identical shell command really
 *       re-runs instead of being swallowed as a repeat.
 *   B8  the agent injects the long shell timeout, so a build is not killed at
 *       the Rust side's 2-minute default.
 *   C1  file_read pages: offset/limit return a window, not the whole file.
