/**
 * Regression cover for the 2.6.3 renderer Out of Memory (Morgan, 2026-08-03).
 *
 * The fix has two halves that only a real browser can check together:
 *   1. chatStore persists through a COALESCING storage, so a streaming answer
 *      costs a handful of IndexedDB writes instead of one per animation frame.
 *      The risk of any write coalescing is losing the tail — so this asserts
 *      the finished answer really is on disk and survives a reload.
 *   2. MessageBubble is memo()d, which only holds up while MessageList hands it
 *      stable handlers. Get that wrong and the streaming bubble freezes
 *      mid-answer — invisible to unit tests, obvious here.
 *
 * The reply arrives in 24 frames so the store is driven the way a real engine
 * drives it, not in one shot.

/**
 * Scoped to the TRANSCRIPT, and to paragraphs. Two different traps:
 *
 *  1. the sidebar shows the first message as the conversation title, so a bare
 *     `getByText` matches it a second time — hence `getByRole('main')`;
 *  2. Playwright's text engine reads a `<textarea>`'s VALUE as its text. While
 *     a typed message still sits in the composer, `main.getByText('…MARKER')`
 *     therefore matches the COMPOSER. That is not a detail: it is how the
 *     previous version of this spec could assert "the second message is on
 *     screen" about a send the app had silently dropped — the text it found
 *     was the text still waiting in the input. Messages render as paragraphs;
 *     the composer does not.
