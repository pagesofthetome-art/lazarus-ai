# Contributing to Lazarus

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project thrives on community input.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 22+ ([download](https://nodejs.org/))
- **Ollama** ([download](https://ollama.com/)) — for text model testing
- **ComfyUI** (optional) — only needed for image/video gen features
- **Git** (obviously)

### Dev Setup

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Lazarus
npm install
```

You have three dev workflows, depending on what you're working on:

```bash
# Full Tauri dev — hot-reload React + live Rust rebuilds. Use for 95 % of work.
npm run tauri:dev

# Browser-only — no Rust, no Tauri shell. Fast feedback for pure UI tweaks.
# Tauri invokes (backendCall, auto-update, filesystem access) do NOT work here.
npm run dev           # serves at http://localhost:5173

# Production build — emits a signed .exe / .msi / .AppImage / .deb / .rpm into
# src-tauri/target/release/bundle/. Use when you want to test a real installer.
npm run tauri:build
```

Most pull requests only need `npm run tauri:dev`. Thanks to @k-wilkinson for
flagging that these commands weren't spelled out here.

#### ComfyUI CORS when you run your own instance

If you already have a ComfyUI running **outside** Lazarus (e.g. a long-lived homelab
instance) and you point `npm run tauri:dev` at it, Vite on `:5173` won't match
ComfyUI's origin check and you'll see `403` on `/prompt` + a console warning:
`request with non matching host and origin localhost:8188 != localhost:5173`.

Start your ComfyUI with:

```bash
python main.py --listen 127.0.0.1 --port 8188 --enable-cors-header "*"
```

LU's own auto-started ComfyUI already passes this flag — you only need it when
you're bringing your own. Thanks to @diimmortalis for flagging this in Discord.

## Tech Stack

- **React 19** + **TypeScript** — strict mode, functional components only
- **Tailwind CSS 4** — utility-first, glassmorphism UI
- **Zustand** — state management with localStorage persistence
- **Vite 8** — build tool
- **Framer Motion** — animations

## How to Contribute

### Bug Reports

Use this repository's issue tracker to report a bug. Include:

- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Your OS, browser, GPU info
- Console errors (if any)

### Feature Requests

Use this repository's issue tracker to request a feature. Describe:

- What problem it solves
- How you'd expect it to work
- Alternatives you've considered

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch from `master`: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. Make your changes
4. Test locally with `npm run dev`
5. Run type checking: `npx tsc --noEmit`
6. Commit with a descriptive message
7. Push and open a PR against `master`

### Code Style

- **TypeScript strict mode** — no `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- **Functional components** — no class components
- **Named exports** — prefer named over default exports
- **Tailwind** — use utility classes, avoid custom CSS when possible
- **Component files** — one component per file, filename matches component name
- **Hooks** — extract logic into custom hooks in `src/hooks/`

### Commit Messages

Keep them short and descriptive:

```
Add video generation progress bar
Fix persona selection on new chat
Update Ollama API client for v0.5 compatibility
```

No need for conventional commits — just be clear about what changed.

## Areas Where Help is Needed

- **Linux/Mac testing** — setup.sh improvements, OS-specific bugs
- **Model compatibility** — testing with different Ollama models
- **ComfyUI workflows** — new image/video generation workflows
- **Accessibility** — keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **i18n** — translations for non-English users
- **Documentation** — tutorials, guides, video walkthroughs
